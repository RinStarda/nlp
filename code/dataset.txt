cat¡¯s tail twitched eyes narrowed 
nothing like man ever seen privet drive 
tall, thin, old, judging silver hair beard, long enough tuck belt 
wearing long robes, purple cloak swept ground, high-heeled, buckled boots

¡°but that¡¯s reason lose heads 
people downright careless, streets broad daylight, even dressed muggle clothes, swapping rumors 
¡± threw sharp, sideways glance dumbledore here, though hoping going tell something, didn¡¯t, went 
¡°a fine thing would if, day you- know-who seems disappeared last, muggles found us

¡°voldemort powers never

plain whatever ¡°everyone¡± saying, going believe dumbledore told true 
dumbledore, however, choosing another lemon drop answer 
¡°what they¡¯re saying ,¡± pressed on, ¡°is last night voldemort turned godric¡¯s hollow

chapter thirteen nicholas flamel dumbledore convinced harry go looking mirror erised again, rest christmas holidays invisibility cloak stayed folded bottom trunk 
harry wished could forget he¡¯d seen mirror easily, couldn¡¯t 
started nightmares 
dreamed parents disappearing flash green light, high voice cackled laughter 
¡°you see, dumbledore right, mirror could drive mad,¡± said ron, harry told dreams 
hermione, came back day tenn started, took different view things 
torn horror idea harry bed, roaming school three nights row (¡°if filch caught you!¡±), disappointment hadn¡¯t least found nicolas flamel 
almost given hope ever finding flamel library book, even though harry still sure he¡¯d read name somewhere 
term started, back skimming books ten minutes breaks 
harry even less time two, quidditch practice started 
wood working team harder ever 
even endless rain replaced snow couldn¡¯t dampen spirits 
weasleys complained wood becoming fanatic, harry wood¡¯s side 
next match, hufflepuff, would overtake slytherin house championship first time seven years 
quite apart wanting win, harry found fewer nightmares tired training 
then, one particularly wet muddy practice session, wood gave team bit bad news 
he¡¯d gotten angry weasleys, kept dive-bombing pretending fall brooms 
¡°will stop messing around!¡± yelled 
¡°that¡¯s exactly sort thing that¡¯ll lose us match! snape¡¯s refereeing time, he¡¯ll looking excuse knock points gryffindor!¡± george weasley really fall broom words 
¡° snape ¡¯s refereeing?¡± spluttered mouthful mud 
¡°when¡¯s ever refereed quidditch match? he¡¯s going fair might overtake slytherin 
¡± rest team landed next george complain, 
¡°it¡¯s fault,¡± said wood 
¡°we¡¯ve got make sure play clean game, snape hasn¡¯t got excuse pick us 
¡± well, thought harry, another reason wanting snape near playing quidditch 


rest team hung back talk one another usual end practice, harry headed straight back gryffindor common room, found ron hennione playing chess 
chess thing hennione ever lost at, something harry ron thought good 
¡°don¡¯t talk moment,¡± said ron harry sat next him, ¡°i need concen ¡ª ¡± caught sight harry¡¯s face 
¡°what¡¯s matter you? look terrible 
¡± speaking quietly one else would hear, harry told two snape ¡¯s sudden, sinister desire quidditch referee 
¡°don¡¯t play,¡± said hennione 
¡°say you¡¯re ill,¡± said ron 
¡°pretend break leg,¡± hennione suggested 
¡° really break leg,¡± said ron 
¡°i can¡¯t,¡± said harry 
¡°there isn¡¯t reserve seeker 
back out, gryffindor can¡¯t play 
¡± moment neville toppled common room 
managed climb portrait hole anyone¡¯s guess, legs stuck together recognized leg-locker curse 
must bunny hop way gryffindor tower 
everyone fell laughing except hennione, leapt perfonned countercurse 
neville¡¯s legs sprang apart got feet, trembling 
¡°what happened?¡± hennione asked him, leading sit harry ron 
¡°malfoy,¡± said neville shakily 
¡°i met outside library 
said he¡¯d looking someone practice 
¡± ¡°go professor mcgonagall!¡± hennione urged neville 
¡°report him!¡± neville shook head 
¡°i don¡¯t want trouble,¡± mumbled 
¡°you¡¯ve got stand him, neville!¡± said ron 
¡°he¡¯s used walking people, that¡¯s reason lie front make easier 
¡± ¡°there¡¯s need tell i¡¯m brave enough gryffindor, malfoy¡¯s already done that,¡± neville choked 
harry felt pocket robes pulled chocolate frog, last one box hermione given christmas 
gave neville, looked though might cry 
¡°you¡¯re worth twelve malfoy,¡± harry said 
¡°the sorting hat chose gryffindor, didn¡¯t it? where¡¯s malfoy? stinking slytherin 
¡± neville¡¯s lips twitched weak smile unwrapped frog 
¡°thanks, harry 


think i¡¯ll go bed 


d¡¯you want card, collect them, don¡¯t you?¡± neville walked away, harry looked famous wizard card

¡°i never thought look here!¡± whispered excitedly

hennione ignored 
¡°nicolas flamel, ¡± whispered dramatically, ¡°is known maker sorcerer ¡¯s stoner didn¡¯t quite effect she¡¯d expected 
¡°the what?¡± said harry ron 
¡°oh, honestly, don¡¯t two read? look - read that,

¡± ¡°just long we¡¯re wiping field,¡± said hennione 
match drew nearer, however, harry became nervous, whatever told ron hennione 
rest team wasn¡¯t calm, either 
idea overtaking slytherin house championship wonderful, one done seven years, would allowed to, biased referee? harry didn¡¯t know whether imagining not, seemed keep running snape wherever went 
times, even wondered whether snape following him, trying catch 
potions lessons turning sort weekly torture, snape horrible harry 
could snape possibly know they¡¯d found sorcerer¡¯s stone? harry didn¡¯t see could ¡ª yet sometimes horrible feeling snape could read minds 
harry knew, wished good luck outside locker rooms next afternoon, ron hermione wondering whether they¡¯d ever see alive 
wasn¡¯t you¡¯d call comforting 
harry hardly heard word wood¡¯s pep talk pulled quidditch robes picked nimbus two thousand 
ron hennione, meanwhile, found place stands next neville, couldn¡¯t understand looked grim worried, brought wands match

fred right 
mistaking silver beard 
harry could laughed loud relief, safe 
simply way snape would dare try hurt dumbledore watching 
perhaps snape looking angry teams marched onto field, something ron noticed, 
¡°i¡¯ve never seen snape look mean,¡± told hermione 
¡°look ¡ª they¡¯re

malfoy 
¡°oh, sorry, weasley, didn¡¯t see

¡°wonder long potter¡¯s going stay broom time? anyone want bet? you, weasley?¡± ron didn¡¯t answer; snape awarded hufflepuff penalty george weasley hit bludger 
hermione, fingers crossed lap, squinting fixedly harry, circling game like hawk, looking snitch 
¡°you know think choose people gryffindor team?¡± said malfoy loudly minutes later, snape awarded hufflepuff another penalty reason 
¡°it¡¯s people feel sorry

¡°i¡¯m warning you, malfoy ¡ª one word ¡ª ¡± ¡°ron!¡± said hermione suddenly, ¡°harry ¡ª ¡± ¡°what? where?¡± harry suddenly gone spectacular dive, drew gasps cheers crowd 
hermione stood up, crossed fingers mouth, harry streaked toward ground like bullet 
¡°you¡¯re luck, weasley, potter¡¯s obviously spotted money ground!¡± said malfoy 
ron snapped 
malfoy knew happening, ron top him, wrestling ground 
neville hesitated, clambered back seat help 
¡°come on, harry!¡± hennione screamed, leaping onto seat watch harry sped straight snape ¡ª didn¡¯t even notice malfoy ron rolling around seat, scuffles yelps coming whirl fists neville, crabbe, goyle

¡°ron! ron! you? game¡¯s over! harry¡¯s won! we¡¯ve won! gryffindor lead!¡± shrieked hennione, dancing seat hugging parvati patil row front 
harry jumped broom, foot ground 
couldn¡¯t believe

gryffindors came spilling onto field, saw snape land nearby, white-faced tight-lipped ¡ª harry felt hand shoulder looked dumbledore¡¯s smiling face

¡°can hear something?¡± ron whispered 
harry listened

¡°do think it¡¯s ghost?¡± ¡°i don¡¯t know 


sounds like wings

¡°probably,¡± said harry 
¡°they don¡¯t look vicious, suppose swooped

¡°now what?¡± said ron

¡°ron, come ¡ª hennione, stay stop going i¡¯ll try catch 
right, now!¡± ron dived, hennione rocketed upward, key dodged both, harry streaked it; sped toward wall, harry leaned forward nasty, crunching noise, pinned stone one hand 
ron hermione¡¯s cheers echoed around high chamber 
landed quickly, harry ran door, key struggling hand 
rammed lock turned - worked 
moment lock clicked open, key took flight again, looking battered caught twice 
¡°ready?¡± harry asked two, hand door handle 
nodded 
pulled door open 
next chamber dark couldn¡¯t see anything 
stepped it, light suddenly flooded room reveal astonishing sight 
standing edge huge chessboard, behind black chessmen, taller carved looked like black stone 
facing them, way across chamber, white pieces 
harry, ron hennione shivered slightly - towering white chessmen faces 
¡°now do?¡± harry whispered 
¡°it¡¯s obvious, isn¡¯t it?¡± said ron 
¡°we¡¯ve got play way across room 
¡± behind white pieces could see another door 
¡°how?¡± said hennione nervously 
¡°i think,¡± said ron, ¡°we¡¯re going chessmen 
¡± walked black knight put hand touch knight¡¯s horse

chessmen seemed listening, words knight, bishop, castle turned backs white pieces walked board, leaving three empty squares harry, ron, hennione took 
¡°white always plays first chess,¡± said ron, peering across board 
¡°yes

white queen smashed floor dragged board, lay quite still, facedown 
¡°had let happen,¡± said ron, looking shaken 
¡°leaves free take bishop, hennione, go 
¡± every time one men lost, white pieces showed mercy 
soon huddle limp black players slumped along wall 
twice, ron noticed time harry hennione danger 
darted around board, taking almost many white pieces lost black ones 
¡°we¡¯re nearly there,¡± muttered suddenly 
¡°let think ¡ª let think

shaking, harry moved three spaces left 
white king took crown threw harry¡¯s feet 

chessmen parted bowed, leaving door ahead clear 
one last desperate look back ron, harry hennione charged door next passageway 
¡°what he¡¯s ¡ª ?¡± ¡°he¡¯ll right,¡± said harry, trying convince 
¡°what reckon¡¯s next?¡± ¡°we¡¯ve sprout¡¯s, devil¡¯s snare; flitwick must¡¯ve put charms keys; mcgonagall transfigured chessmen make alive; leaves quirrell¡¯s spell, snape¡¯s 
¡± reached another door 
¡°all right?¡± harry whispered 
¡°go 
¡± harry pushed open 
disgusting smell filled nostrils, making pull robes noses 
eyes watering, saw, flat floor front them, troll even larger one tackled, cold bloody lump head 
¡°i¡¯m glad didn¡¯t fight one,¡± harry whispered stepped carefully one massive legs 
¡°come on, can¡¯t breathe 
¡± pulled open next door, hardly daring look came next - nothing frightening here, table seven differently shaped bottles standing line 
¡°snape¡¯s,¡± said harry 
¡°what do?¡± stepped threshold, immediately fire sprang behind doorway 
wasn¡¯t ordinary fire either; purple 
instant, black flames shot doorway leading onward 
trapped 
¡°look!¡± hermione seized roll paper lying next bottles 
harry looked shoulder read it: danger lies you, safety lies behind, two us help you, ever would find, one among us seven let move ahead, another transport drinker back instead, two among number hold nettle wine, three us killers, waiting bidden line 
choose, unless wish stay forevermore, help choice, give clues four: first, however slyly poison tries hide always find nettle wine ¡¯s left side; second, different stand either end, would move onward, neither friend; third, see clearly, different size, neither dwarf giant holds death insides; fourth, second left second right twins taste them, though different first sight 
hennione let great sigh harry, amazed, saw smiling, last thing felt like 
¡° brilliant ,¡± said hermione 
¡°this isn¡¯t magic ¡ª it¡¯s logic ¡ª puzzle

missed hogwarts much like constant stomachache 
missed castle, secret passageways ghosts, classes (though perhaps snape, potions master), mail arriving owl, eating banquets great hall, sleeping four-poster bed tower dormitory, visiting gamekeeper, hagrid, cabin next forbidden forest grounds, and, especially, quidditch, popular sport wizarding world (six tall goal posts, four flying balls, fourteen players broomsticks)

chamber secrets 


¡°you know, course, hogwarts founded thousand years ago ¡ª precise date uncertain ¡ª four greatest witches wizards age 
four school houses named them: godric gryffindor, helga hufflepuff, rowena ravenclaw, salazar slytherin 
built castle together, far prying muggle eyes, age magic feared common people, witches wizards suffered much persecution 
¡± paused, gazed blearily around room, continued 
¡°for years, founders worked hannony together, seeking youngsters showed signs magic bringing castle educated 
disagreements sprang 
rift began grow slytherin others 
slytherin wished selective students admitted hogwarts 
believed magical learning kept within all-magic families 
disliked taking students muggle parentage, believing untrustworthy 
while, serious argument subject slytherin gryffindor, slytherin left school 
¡± professor binns paused again, pursing lips, looking like wrinkled old tortoise 
¡°reliable historical sources tell us much,¡± said 
¡°but honest facts obscured fanciful legend chamber secrets 
story goes slytherin built hidden chamber castle, founders knew nothing 
¡°slytherin, according legend, sealed chamber secrets none would able open true heir arrived school 
heir alone would able unseal chamber secrets, unleash horror within, use purge school unworthy study magic 
¡± silence finished telling story, wasn¡¯t usual, sleepy silence filled professor binns¡¯s classes 
unease air everyone continued watch him, hoping 
professor binns looked faintly annoyed 
¡°the whole thing arrant nonsense, course,¡± said 
¡°naturally, school searched evidence chamber, many times, learned witches wizards

¡°if long succession hogwarts headmasters headmistresses haven¡¯t found thing ¡ª ¡± ¡°but, professor,¡± piped parvati patil, ¡°you¡¯d probably use dark magic open ¡ª ¡± ¡°just wizard 7 use dark magic doesn¡¯t mean 7, miss pennyfeather,¡± snapped professor binns 
¡°i repeat, likes dumbledore ¡ª ¡± ¡°but maybe you¡¯ve got related slytherin, dumbledore couldn¡¯t ¡ª ¡± began dean thomas, professor binns enough 
¡°that do,¡± said sharply

¡°hany ¡ª harry ¡ª boy class saying you¡¯re ¡ª ¡± cohn small couldn¡¯t fight tide people bearing toward great hall; heard squeak, ¡°see you, harry!¡± gone

crowd thinned able climb next staircase without difficulty 
¡°d¡¯you really think there¡¯s chamber secrets?¡± ron asked hennione 
¡°i don¡¯t know,¡± said, frowning 
¡°dumbledore couldn¡¯t cure mrs

quietly, harry tried say something parseltongue 
words wouldn¡¯t come 
seemed face-to-face snake

sorting hat wouldn¡¯t put slytherin blood 


ah, said nasty little voice brain, sorting hat wanted put slytherin, don¡¯t remember? harry turned

shivering, harry walked past classrooms lessons taking place, catching snatches happening within 
professor mcgonagall shouting someone who, sound it, turned friend badger 
resisting urge take look, harry walked by, thinking justin might using free time catch work, deciding check library first 
group hufflepuffs herbology indeed sitting back library, didn¡¯t seem working 
long lines high bookshelves, harry could see heads close together looked like absorbing conversation 
couldn¡¯t see whether justin among 
walking toward something saying met ears, paused listen, hidden invisibility section 
¡°so anyway,¡± stout boy saying, ¡°i told justin hide dormitory

¡°no one knows survived attack you-know-who

really powerful dark wizard could survived curse like 
¡± dropped voice barely whisper, said, ¡°that¡¯s probably you- know- wanted kill first place 
didn¡¯t want another dark lord competing 
wonder powers potter¡¯s hiding?¡± harry couldn¡¯t take anymore 
clearing throat loudly, stepped behind bookshelves 
hadn¡¯t feeling angry, would found sight greeted funny: every one hufflepuffs looked though petrified sight him, color draining ernie¡¯s face 
¡°hello,¡± said harry 
¡°i¡¯m looking justin finch-fletchley 
¡± hufflepuffs¡¯ worst fears clearly confirmed

¡°what want him?¡± said ernie quavering voice 
¡°i wanted tell really happened snake dueling club,¡± said harry 
ernie bit white lips then, taking deep breath, said, ¡°we

¡°all saw,¡± said ernie stubbornly, though trembling spoke, ¡°was speaking parseltongue chasing snake toward justin 
¡± ¡°i didn¡¯t chase him!¡± harry said, voice shaking anger 
¡°it didn¡¯t even touch him!¡± ¡°it near miss,¡± said ernie 
¡°and case you¡¯re getting ideas,¡± added hastily, ¡°i might tell trace family back nine generations witches warlocks blood¡¯s pure anyone¡¯s, ¡ª ¡± 1 don¡¯t care sort blood you¡¯ve got!¡± said harry fiercely 
¡°why would want attack muggle-boms?¡± ¡°i¡¯ve heard hate muggles live with,¡± said ernie swiftly

¡°i¡¯d like see try

harry blundered corridor, barely noticing going, fury 
result walked something large solid, knocked backward onto floor 
¡°oh, hello, hagrid,¡± harry said, looking 
hagrid¡¯s face entirely hidden woolly, snow-covered balaclava, couldn¡¯t possibly anyone else, filled corridor moleskin overcoat

¡± harry stamped stairs turned along another corridor, particularly dark; torches extinguished strong, icy draft blowing loose windowpane 
halfway passage tripped headlong something lying floor 
turned squint he¡¯d fallen felt though stomach dissolved 
justin finch-fletchley lying floor, rigid cold, look shock frozen face, eyes staring blankly ceiling

peeves poltergeist came shooting 
¡°why, it¡¯s potty wee potter!¡± cackled peeves, knocking harry¡¯s glasses askew bounced past 
¡°what¡¯s potter to? why¡¯s potter lurking ¡ª ¡± peeves stopped, halfway midair somersault

flipped right way up, fdled lungs and, harry could stop him, screamed, ¡°attack! attack! another attack! mortal ghost safe! run lives! attaaaack!¡± crash ¡ª crash ¡ª crash ¡ª door door flew open along corridor people flooded 
several long minutes, scene confusion justin danger squashed people kept standing nearly headless nick 
harry found pinned wall teachers shouted quiet 
professor mcgonagall came running, followed class, one still black-and-white-striped hair 
used wand set loud bang, restored silence, ordered everyone back classes 
sooner scene cleared somewhat ernie hufflepuff arrived, panting, scene 
¡°caught act!¡± ernie yelled, face stark white, pointing finger dramatically harry 
¡°that do, macmillan!¡± said professor mcgonagall sharply 
peeves bobbing overhead, grinning wickedly, surveying scene; peeves always loved chaos 
teachers bent justin nearly headless nick, examining them, peeves broke song: ¡°oh, potter, rotter, oh, done, you¡¯re killing students, think it¡¯s good fun¡ª¡± ¡°that¡¯s enough peeves!¡± barked professor mcgonagall, peeves zoomed away backward, tongue harry 
justin carried hospital wing professor flitwick professor sinistra astronomy department, nobody seemed know nearly headless nick 
end, professor mcgonagall conjured large fan thin air, gave ernie instructions waft nearly headless nick stairs 
ernie did, fanning nick along like silent black hovercraft 
left harry professor mcgonagall alone together 
¡°this way, potter,¡± said 
¡°professor,¡± said harry once, ¡°i swear didn¡¯t ¡ª ¡± ¡°this hands, potter,¡± said professor mcgonagall curtly 
marched silence around corner stopped large extremely ugly stone gargoyle 
¡°lemon drop!¡± said 
evidently password, gargoyle sprang suddenly life hopped aside wall behind split two 
even full dread coming, harry couldn¡¯t fail amazed 
behind wall spiral staircase moving smoothly upward, like escalator 
professor mcgonagall stepped onto it, harry heard wall thud closed behind

professor mcgonagall told harry wait left there, alone 
harry looked around 
one thing certain: teachers¡¯ offices harry visited far year, dumbledore¡¯s far interesting 
hadn¡¯t scared wits thrown school, would pleased chance look around 
large beautiful circular room, full funny little noises 
number curious silver instruments stood spindle legged tables, whirring emitting little puffs smoke 
walls covered portraits old headmasters headmistresses, snoozing gently frames 
also enonnous, claw-footed desk, and, sitting shelf behind it, shabby, tattered wizard¡¯s hat ¡ª sorting hat 
harry hesitated 
cast wary eye around sleeping witches wizards walls 
surely couldn¡¯t hurt took hat tried again? see 


make sure put right house 
walked quietly around desk, lifted hat shelf, lowered slowly onto head 
much large slipped eyes, done last time he¡¯d put 
harry stared black inside hat, waiting

harry pushed back onto shelf, feeling sick 
¡°you¡¯re wrong,¡± said aloud still silent hat

harry backed away, watching 
strange, gagging noise behind made wheel around 
wasn¡¯t alone 
standing golden perch behind door decrepit-looking bird resembled half-plucked turkey 
harry stared bird looked balefully back, making gagging noise 
harry thought looked ill 
eyes dull and, even harry watched, couple feathers fell tail 
harry thinking needed dumbledore¡¯s pet bird die alone office it, bird burst flames 
harry yelled shock backed away desk 
looked feverishly around case glass water somewhere couldn¡¯t see one; bird, meanwhile, become fireball; gave one loud shriek next second nothing smoldering pile ash floor 
office door opened 
dumbledore came in, looking somber 
¡°professor,¡± harry gasped 
¡°your bird ¡ª couldn¡¯t anything ¡ª caught fire ¡ª ¡± harry¡¯s astonishment, dumbledore smiled 
¡°about time, too,¡± said 
¡°he¡¯s looking dreadful days; i¡¯ve telling get move

¡± shock fawkes catching fire, harry forgotten for, came back dumbledore settled high chair behind desk fixed harry penetrating, light-blue stare 
dumbledore could speak another word, however, door office flew open almighty bang hagrid burst in, wild look eyes, balaclava perched top shaggy black head dead rooster still swinging hand 
¡°it wasn¡¯ harry, professor dumbledore!¡± said hagrid urgently

¡°you don¡¯t think me, professor?¡± harry repeated hopefully dumbledore brushed rooster feathers desk 
¡°no, harry, don¡¯t,¡± said dumbledore, though face somber 
¡°but still want talk 
¡± harry waited nervously dumbledore considered him, tips long fingers together 
¡°i must ask you, harry, whether anything you¡¯d like tell me,¡± said gently 
¡°anything

thought malfoy shouting, ¡°you¡¯ll next, mudbloods!¡± polyjuice potion simmering away moaning myrtle¡¯s bathroom

¡± thought, too, everyone saying him, growing dread somehow connected salazar slytherin 


¡°no,¡± said harry 
¡°there isn¡¯t anything, professor 


¡± double attack justin nearly headless nick turned hitherto nervousness real panic

ginny didn¡¯t find amusing either 
¡°oh, don¡¯t,¡± wailed every time fred asked harry loudly planning attack next, george pretended ward harry large clove garlic met 
harry didn¡¯t mind; made feel better fred george, least, thought idea slytherin¡¯s heir quite ludicrous 
antics seemed aggravating draco malfoy, looked increasingly sour time saw 
¡°it¡¯s he¡¯s bursting say it¡¯s really him,¡± said ron knowingly 
¡°you kn ow hates anyone beating anything, you¡¯re getting credit dirty work

well, riddle got special award catching heir slytherin? diary would probably tell us everything ¡ª chamber is, open it, sort creature lives ¡ª person who¡¯s behind attacks time wouldn¡¯t want lying around, would they?¡± ¡°that¡¯s brilliant theory, hermione,¡± said ron, ¡°with one tiny little flaw 
there¡¯s nothing written diary

harry sure never heard name

¡°the moment acne clears up, they¡¯ll ready repotting again,¡± harry heard telling filch kindly one afternoon 
¡°and that, won¡¯t long we¡¯re cutting stewing

¡± perhaps heir slytherin lost nerve, thought harry 
must getting riskier riskier open chamber secrets, school alert suspicious 
perhaps monster, whatever was, even settling hibernate another fifty years 


ernie macmillan hufflepuff didn¡¯t take cheerful view 
still convinced harry guilty one, ¡°given away¡± dueling club 
peeves wasn¡¯t helping matters; kept popping crowded corridors singing ¡°oh, potter, rotter 


¡± dance routine match 
gilderoy lockhart seemed think made attacks stop 
harry overheard telling professor mcgonagall gryffindors lining transfiguration 
¡°i don¡¯t think there¡¯ll trouble, minerva,¡± said, tapping nose knowingly winking

harry hadn¡¯t much sleep late-running quidditch practice night before, hurried great hall, slightly late 
thought, moment, he¡¯d walked wrong doors 
walls covered large, lurid pink flowers 
worse still, heart-shaped confetti falling pale blue ceiling 
harry went gryffindor table, ron sitting looking sickened, hennione seemed overcome giggles 
¡°what¡¯s going on?¡± harry asked them, sitting wiping confetti bacon 
ron pointed teachers¡¯ table, apparently disgusted speak 
lockhart, wearing lurid pink robes match decorations, waving silence

snape looking though first person ask love potion would force-fed poison 
¡°please, hennione, tell weren¡¯t one forty-six,¡± said ron left great hall first lesson 
hennione suddenly became interested searching bag schedule didn¡¯t answer

¡°off go, go, bell rang five minutes ago, class, now,¡± said, shooing younger students away 
¡°and you, malfoy ¡ª ¡± harry, glancing over, saw malfoy stoop snatch something 
leering, showed crabbe goyle, harry realized he¡¯d got riddle¡¯s diary 
¡°give back,¡± said harry quietly 
¡°wonder potter¡¯s written this?¡± said malfoy, obviously hadn¡¯t noticed year cover thought harry¡¯s diary

thing bowled scuttled away, tearing corridor sight 
riddle scrambled feet, looking it; raised wand, huge boy leapt him, seized wand, threw back down, yelling, ¡°noooooo!¡± scene whirled, darkness became complete; harry felt falling and, crash, landed spread-eagled four-poster gryffindor dormitory, riddle¡¯s diary lying open stomach 
time regain breath, dormitory door opened ron came 
¡°there are,¡± said 
harry sat 
sweating shaking 
¡°what¡¯s up?¡± said ron, looking concern 
¡°it hagrid, ron 
hagrid opened chamber secrets fifty years ago 
¡± chapter fourteen cornelius fudge harry, ron, hennione always known hagrid unfortunate liking large monstrous creatures 
first year hogwarts tried raise dragon little wooden house, would long time forgot giant, three-headed dog he¡¯d christened ¡°fluffy 
¡± if, boy, hagrid heard monster hidden somewhere castle, harry sure he¡¯d gone lengths glimpse 
he¡¯d probably thought shame monster cooped long, thought deserved chance stretch many legs; harry could imagine thirteen-year-old hagrid trying fit leash collar 
equally certain hagrid would never meant kill anybody 
harry half wished hadn¡¯t found work riddle¡¯s diary 
ron hennione made recount he¡¯d seen, heartily sick telling sick long, circular conversations followed 
¡°riddle might got wrong person,¡± said hennione 
¡°maybe monster attacking people 


¡± ¡°how many monsters d¡¯you think place hold?¡± ron asked dully 
¡°we always knew hagrid expelled,¡± said harry miserably 
¡°and attacks must¡¯ve stopped hagrid kicked 
otherwise, riddle wouldn¡¯t got award 
¡± ron tried different tack 
¡°riddle sound like percy ¡ª asked squeal hagrid, anyway?¡± ¡°but monster killed someone, ron,¡± said hennione 
¡°and riddle going go back muggle orphanage closed hogwarts,¡± said hany 
¡°i don¡¯t blame wanting stay 


¡± ¡°you met hagrid knockturn alley, didn¡¯t you, harry?¡± ¡°he buying flesh-eating slug repellent,¡± said harry quickly 
three fell silent 
long pause, hennione voiced knottiest question hesitant voice 
¡°do think go ask hagrid all?¡± ¡°that¡¯d cheerful visit,¡± said ron 
¡®¡°hello, hagrid 
tell us, setting anything mad hairy loose castle lately?¡¯¡± end, decided would say anything hagrid unless another attack, days went whisper disembodied voice, became hopeful would never need talk expelled 
nearly four months since justin nearly headless nick petrified, nearly everybody seemed think attacker, whoever was, retired good 
peeves finally got bored ¡°oh, potter, rotter¡± song, ernie macmillan asked harry quite politely pass bucket leaping toadstools herbology one day, march several mandrakes threw loud raucous party greenhouse three 
made professor sprout happy 
¡°the moment start trying move other¡¯s pots, we¡¯ll know they¡¯re fully mature,¡± told harry

¡°we keep old subjects, i¡¯d¡¯ve ditched defense dark arts 
¡± ¡°but that¡¯s important!¡± said hennione, shocked 
¡°not way lockhart teaches it,¡± said ron 
¡°i haven¡¯t learned anything except set pixies loose 
¡± neville longbottom sent letters witches wizards family, giving different advice choose 
confused worried, sat reading subject lists tongue poking out, asking people whether thought arithmancy sounded difficult study ancient runes 
dean thomas, who, like harry, grown muggles, ended closing eyes jabbing wand list, picking subjects landed 
hennione took nobody¡¯s advice signed everything 
harry smiled grimly thought uncle vernon aunt petunia would say tried discuss career wizardry 
didn¡¯t get guidance: percy weasley eager share experience 
¡°depends want go, harry,¡± said 
¡°it¡¯s never early think future, i¡¯d recommend divination 
people say muggle studies soft option, personally think wizards thorough understanding non-magical community, particularly they¡¯re thinking working close contact ¡ª look father, deal muggle business time 
brother charlie always outdoor type, went care magical creatures

walked behind twenty minutes, speaking, listening hard noises breaking twigs rustling leaves 
then, trees become thicker ever, stars overhead longer visible, harry¡¯s wand shone alone sea dark, saw spider guides leaving path 
harry paused, trying see spiders going, everything outside little sphere light pitch-black

while, noticed ground seemed sloping downward, though trees thick ever 
fang suddenly let loose great, echoing bark, making harry ron jump skins

¡°we name it! never even told hagrid name dread creature, though asked me, many times 
¡± harry didn¡¯t want press subject, spiders pressing closer sides 
aragog seemed tired talking 
backing slowly domed web, fellow spiders continued inch slowly toward harry ron 
¡°we¡¯ll go, then,¡± harry called desperately aragog, hearing leaves rustling behind

¡± together walked back gateway muggle world 

chapter one owl post harry potter highly unusual boy many ways 
one thing, hated summer holidays time year 
another, really wanted homework forced secret, dead night 
also happened wizard 
nearly midnight, lying stomach bed, blankets drawn right head like tent, flashlight one hand large leather-bound book (a history magic bathilda bagshot) propped open pillow 
harry moved tip eagle-feather quill page, frowning looked something would help write essay, ¡®witch burning fourteenth century completely pointless ¡ª discuss 
¡¯ quill paused top likely looking paragraph 
harry pushed round glasses bridge nose, moved flashlight closer book, read: non-magic people (more commonly known muggles) particularly afraid magic medieval times, good recognizing 
rare occasion catch real witch wizard, burn ing effect whatsoever 
witch wizard would perform basic flame-freezing charm pretend shriek pain enjoying gentle, tickling sensation 
indeed, wendelin weird enjoyed burned much allowed caught less forty-seven times various disguises 
harry put quill teeth reached underneath pillow inkbottle roll parchment 
slowly carefully unscrewed ink bottle, dipped quill it, began write, pausing every listen, dursleys heard scratching quill way bathroom, he¡¯d probably find locked cupboard stairs rest summer 
dursley family number four, privet drive, reason harry never enjoyed summer holidays 
uncle vernon, aunt petunia, son, dudley, harry¡¯s living relatives 
muggles, medieval attitude toward magic 
harry¡¯s dead parents, witch wizard themselves, never mentioned dursleys¡¯ roof 
years, aunt petunia uncle vernon hoped kept harry downtrodden possible, would able squash magic 
fury, unsuccessful 
days lived terror anyone finding harry spent last two years hogwarts school witchcraft wizardry 
could do, however, lock away harry¡¯s spell books, wand, cauldron, broomstick start summer break, forbid talk neighbors 
separation spell books real problem harry, teachers hogwarts given lot holiday work 
one essays, particularly nasty one shrinking potions, harry¡¯s least favorite teacher, professor snape, would delighted excuse give harry detention month 
harry therefore seized chance first week holidays 
uncle vernon, aunt petunia, dudley gone front garden admire uncle vernon¡¯s new company car (in loud voices, rest street would notice too), harry crept downstairs, picked lock cupboard stairs, grabbed books, hidden bedroom 
long didn¡¯t leave spots ink sheets, dursleys need never know studying magic night 
harry particularly keen avoid trouble aunt uncle moment, already especially bad mood him, he¡¯d received telephone call fellow wizard one week school vacation 
ron weasley, one harry¡¯s best friends hogwarts, came whole family wizards 
meant knew lot things harry didn¡¯t, never used telephone 
unluckily, uncle vernon answered call 
¡°vernon dursley speaking 
¡± harry, happened room time, froze heard ron¡¯s voice answer 
¡°hello? hello? hear me? ¡ª want ¡ª ¡ª talk ¡ª ¡ª harry ¡ª potter!¡± ron yelling loudly uncle vernon jumped held receiver foot away ear, staring expression mingled fury alarm 
¡°who this?¡± roared direction mouthpiece

¡°i¡¯m ¡ª ¡ª friend ¡ª ¡ª harry¡¯s ¡ª ¡ª school ¡ª ¡± uncle vernon¡¯s small eyes swiveled around harry, rooted spot 
¡°there harry potter here!¡± roared, holding receiver arm¡¯s length, though frightened might explode 
¡°i don¡¯t know school you¡¯re talking about! never contact again! don¡¯t come near family!¡± threw receiver back onto telephone dropping poisonous spider 
fight followed one worst ever 
¡°how dare give number people like ¡ª people like \ ¡± uncle vernon roared, spraying harry spit 
ron obviously realized he¡¯d gotten harry trouble, hadn¡¯t called 
harry¡¯s best friend hogwarts, hennione granger, hadn¡¯t touch either 
harry suspected ron warned hennione call, pity, hennione, cleverest witch harry¡¯s year, muggle parents, knew perfectly well use telephone, would probably enough sense say went hogwarts 
harry word wizarding friends five long weeks, summer turning almost bad last one 
one small improvement ¡ª swearing wouldn¡¯t use send letters friends, harry allowed let owl, hedwig, night 
uncle vernon given racket hedwig made locked cage time 
harry finished writing wendelin weird paused listen 
silence dark house broken distant, grunting snores enormous cousin, dudley 
must late, harry thought

handed monday 

¡± talking excitedly, class left staffroom 
harry, however, wasn¡¯t feeling cheerful 
professor lupin deliberately stopped tackling boggart 
why? he¡¯d seen harry collapse train, thought wasn¡¯t much? thought harry would pass again? one else seemed noticed anything 
¡°did see take banshee?¡± shouted seamus

red caps moved kappas, creepy, water-dwellers looked like scaly monkeys, webbed hands itching strangle unwitting waders ponds 
harry wished happy classes 
worst potions 
snape particularly vindictive mood days, one doubt 
story boggart assuming snape¡¯s shape, way neville dressed grandmother¡¯s clothes, traveled school like wildfire 
snape didn¡¯t seem find funny

harry also growing dread hours spent professor trelawney¡¯s stifling tower room, deciphering lopsided shapes symbols, trying ignore way professor trelawney¡¯s enonnous eyes filled tears every time looked

nobody really liked care magical creatures, which, action-packed first class, become extremely dull 
hagrid seemed lost confidence 
spending lesson lesson learning look flobberworms, boring creatures existence 
¡°why would anyone bother looking them?¡± said ron, yet another hour poking shredded lettuce flobberworms¡¯ throats

george weasley made lunge crookshanks missed; scabbers streaked twenty pairs legs shot beneath old chest drawers 
crookshanks skidded halt, crouched low bandy legs, started making furious swipes beneath front paw 
ron hennione hurried over; hennione grabbed crookshanks around middle heaved away; ron threw onto stomach and, great difficulty, pulled scabbers tail 
¡°look him!¡± said furiously hennione, dangling scabbers front

hall immediately began buzz excitedly; gryffindors telling rest school happened 
¡°everyone sleeping bags!¡± shouted percy 
¡°come on, now, talking! lights ten minutes!¡± ¡°c¡¯mon,¡± ron said harry hermione; seized three sleeping bags dragged comer

¡°honestly, person who¡¯s ever bothered read hogwarts, history ?¡± said hermione crossly harry ron 
¡°probably,¡± said ron 
¡°why?¡± ¡°because castle¡¯s protected walls, know,¡± said hermione 
¡°there sorts enchantments it, stop people entering stealth 
can¡¯t apparate 
i¡¯d like see disguise could fool dementors 
they¡¯re guarding every single entrance grounds 
they¡¯d seen fly 
filch knows secret passages, they¡¯ll covered 


¡± ¡°the lights going now!¡± percy shouted 
¡°i want everyone sleeping bags talking!¡± candles went 
light came silvery ghosts, drifting talking seriously prefects, enchanted ceiling, which, like sky outside, scattered stars 
that, whispering still filled hall, harry felt though sleeping outdoors light wind 
every hour, teacher would reappear hall check everything quiet 
around three morning, many students finally fallen asleep, professor dumbledore came 
harry watched looking around percy, prowling sleeping bags, telling people talking 
percy short way away harry, ron, hennione, quickly pretended asleep dumbledore ¡¯s footsteps drew nearer 
¡°any sign him, professor?¡± asked percy whisper 
¡°no

¡°you remember conversation had, headmaster, ¡ª ah ¡ª start term?¡± said snape, barely opening lips, though trying block percy conversation 
¡°i do, severus,¡± said dumbledore, something like warning voice 
¡°it seems ¡ª almost impossible ¡ª black could entered school without inside help 
express concerns appointed ¡ª ¡± ¡°i believe single person inside castle would helped black enter it,¡± said dumbledore, tone made clear subject closed snape didn¡¯t reply 
¡°i must go dementors,¡± said dumbledore

¡°there¡¯s nothing wrong malfoy¡¯s arm!¡± said harry furiously 
¡°he¡¯s faking it!¡± ¡°i know that, can¡¯t prove it,¡± said wood bitterly, ¡°and we¡¯ve practicing moves assuming we¡¯re playing slytherin, instead it¡¯s hufflepuff, style¡¯s quite different 
they¡¯ve got new captain seeker, cedric diggory ¡ª ¡± angelina, alicia, katie suddenly giggled

¡°he¡¯s tall, good-looking one, isn¡¯t he?¡± said angelina 
¡°strong silent,¡± said katie, started giggle 
¡°he¡¯s silent he¡¯s thick string two words together,¡± said fred impatiently 
¡°i don¡¯t know you¡¯re worried, oliver, hufflepuff pushover 
last time played them, harry caught snitch five minutes, remember?¡± ¡°we playing completely different conditions!¡± wood shouted, eyes bulging slightly 
¡°diggory¡¯s put strong side together! he¡¯s excellent seeker! afraid you¡¯d take like this! mustn¡¯t relax! must keep focus! slytherin trying wrong-foot us! must win!¡± ¡°oliver, calm down!¡± said fred, looking slightly alarmed

snape looked around class 
¡°as saying potter interrupted, professor lupin left record topics covered far ¡ª ¡± ¡°please, sir, we¡¯ve done boggarts, red caps, kappas, grindylows,¡± said hermione quickly, ¡°and we¡¯re start ¡ª ¡± ¡°be quiet,¡± said snape coldly

¡°snape¡¯s never like defense dark arts teachers, even want job,¡± harry said hermione 
¡°why¡¯s got lupin? d¡¯you think boggart?¡± ¡°i don¡¯t know,¡± said hennione pensively 
¡°but really hope professor lupin gets better soon 


¡± ron caught five minutes later, towering rage 
¡°d¡¯you know ¡ª ¡± (he called snape something made hermione say ¡° ronl ¡±) ¡° ¡ª making do? i¡¯ve got scrub bedpans hospital wing

finally, gave thought sleep, got up, dressed, picked nimbus two thousand, walked quietly dormitory 
harry opened door, something brushed leg 
bent time grab crookshanks end bushy tail drag outside 
¡°you know, reckon ron right you,¡± harry told crookshanks suspiciously 
¡°there plenty mice around place ¡ª go chase

harry knew better think match would canceled; quidditch matches weren¡¯t called trifles like thunderstorms 
nevertheless, starting feel apprehensive 
wood pointed cedric diggory corridor; diggory fifth year lot bigger harry

harry whiled away hours dawn front fire, getting every stop crookshanks sneaking boys¡¯ staircase

¡°stand fight, mangy cur!¡± yelled sir cadogan 
¡°oh, shut up,¡± harry yawned 
revived bit large bowl porridge, time he¡¯d started toast, rest team turned

team changed scarlet robes waited wood¡¯s usual pre-match pep talk, didn¡¯t come 
tried speak several times, made odd gulping noise, shook head hopelessly beckoned follow 
wind strong staggered sideways walked onto field

harry rose fast, nimbus swerving slightly wind

flew backward forward across field past blurred red yellow shapes, idea happening rest game 
couldn¡¯t hear commentary wind 
crowd hidden beneath sea cloaks battered umbrellas 
twice harry came close unseated bludger; vision clouded rain glasses hadn¡¯t seen coming 
lost track time 
getting harder harder hold broom straight 
sky getting darker, though night decided come early 
twice harry nearly hit another player, without knowing whether teammate opponent; everyone wet, rain thick, could hardly tell apart 


first flash lightning came sound madam hooch¡¯s whistle; harry could see outline wood thick rain, gesturing ground 
whole team splashed mud 
¡°i called time-out!¡± wood roared team 
¡°come on, ¡ª ¡± huddled edge field large umbrella; harry took glasses wiped hurriedly robes 
¡°what¡¯s score?¡± ¡°we¡¯re fifty points up,¡± said wood, ¡°but unless get snitch soon, we¡¯ll playing night

another clap thunder, followed immediately forked lightning 
getting dangerous 
harry needed get snitch quickly ¡ª turned, intending head back toward middle field, moment, another flash lightning illuminated stands, harry saw something distracted completely, silhouette enormous shaggy black dog, clearly imprinted sky, motionless topmost, empty row seats

shaking sodden bangs eyes, squinted back stands 
dog vanished 
¡°harry!¡± came wood¡¯s anguished yell gryffindor goal posts

ten minutes so, madam pomfrey came tell team leave peace 
¡°we¡¯ll come see later,¡± fred told 
¡°don¡¯t beat harry, you¡¯re still best seeker we¡¯ve ever 
¡± team trooped out, trailing mud behind

didn¡¯t argue complain, wouldn¡¯t let throw away shattered remnants nimbus two thousand

gryffindor running all, although could afford lose another match 
wood became repossessed manic energy, worked team hard ever chilly haze rain persisted december 
harry saw hint dementor within grounds 
dumbledore ¡¯s anger seemed keeping stations entrances 
two weeks end term, sky lightened suddenly dazzling, opaline white muddy grounds revealed one morning covered glittering frost 
inside castle, buzz christmas air 
professor flitwick, charms teacher, already decorated classroom shimmering lights turned real, fluttering fairies 
students happily discussing plans holidays 
ron hennione decided remain hogwarts, though ron said couldn¡¯t stand two weeks percy, hennione insisted needed use library, harry wasn¡¯t fooled; keep company, grateful

saturday morning hogsmeade trip, harry bid good-bye ron hennione, wrapped cloaks scarves, turned marble staircase alone, headed back toward gryffindor tower 
snow started fall outside windows, castle still quiet 
¡°psst ¡ª harry!¡± turned, halfway along third-floor corridor, see fred george peering behind statue humpbacked, one-eyed witch

harry followed fred george inside 
george closed door quietly turned, beaming, look harry 
¡°early christmas present you, harry,¡± said 
fred pulled something inside cloak flourish laid one desks 
large, square, worn piece parchment nothing written 
harry, suspecting one fred george¡¯s jokes, stared 
¡°what¡¯s supposed be?¡± ¡°this, harry, secret success,¡± said george, patting parchment fondly 
¡°it¡¯s wrench, giving you,¡± said fred, ¡°but decided last night, need¡¯s greater

¡°we bequeath

¡°a bit old parchment!¡± said fred, closing eyes grimace though harry mortally offended 
¡°explain, george 
¡± ¡°well

¡°well, would you¡¯ve done?¡± said fred 
¡°george caused diversion dropping another dungbomb, whipped drawer open, grabbed ¡ª 
¡± ¡°it¡¯s bad sounds, know,¡± said george 
¡°we don¡¯t reckon filch ever found work 
probably suspected was, though, wouldn¡¯t confiscated 
¡± ¡°and know work it?¡± ¡°oh yes,¡± said fred, smirking 
¡°this little beauty¡¯s taught us teachers school 
¡± ¡°you¡¯re winding up,¡± said harry, looking ragged old bit parchment 
¡°oh, we?¡± said george 
took wand, touched parchment lightly, said, ¡°/ solemnly swear good 
¡± once, thin ink lines began spread like spider¡¯s web point george¡¯s wand touched 
joined other, crisscrossed, fanned every corner parchment; words began blossom across top, great, curly green words, proclaimed: messrs 
moony, wormtail, padfoot, prongs purveyors aids magical mischief-makers proud present mara uder ¡¯s map map showing every detail hogwarts castle grounds 
truly remarkable thing tiny ink dots moving around it, labeled name minuscule writing 
astounded, harry bent

harry¡¯s eyes traveled familiar corridors, noticed something else 
map showed set passages never entered

¡°we owe much

¡°right,¡± said george briskly 
¡°don¡¯t forget wipe you¡¯ve used ¡ª ¡± ¡° ¡ª anyone read it,¡± fred said warningly 
¡°just tap say, ¡®mischief managed!¡¯ it¡¯ll go blank 
¡± ¡°so, young harry,¡± said fred, uncanny impersonation percy, ¡°mind behave 
¡± ¡°see honeydukes,¡± said george, winking 
left room, smirking satisfied sort way 
harry stood there, gazing miraculous map 
watched tiny ink mrs 
norris turn left pause sniff something floor 
filch really didn¡¯t know 


wouldn¡¯t pass dementors 


even stood there, flooded excitement, something harry heard mr 
weasley say came floating memory 
never trust anything think itself, ¡¯t see keeps brain 
map one dangerous magical objects mr 
weasley warning 


aids magical mischief makers 


then, harry reasoned, wanted use get hogsmeade, wasn¡¯t though wanted steal anything attack anyone 


fred george using years without anything horrible happening 


harry traced secret passage honeydukes linger 
then, quite suddenly, though following orders, rolled map, stuffed inside robes, hurried door classroom 
opened couple inches 
one outside 
carefully, edged room behind statue one-eyed witch 
do? pulled map saw astonishment, new ink figure appeared upon it, labeled ¡®harry potter¡¯ 
figure standing exactly real harry standing, halfway third-floor corridor 
harry watched carefully 
little ink self appeared tapping witch minute wand 
harry quickly took real wand tapped statue 
nothing happened 
looked back map 
tiniest speech bubble appeared next figure 
word inside said, ¡® dissendium 
¡¯ ¡°dissendium!¡± harry whispered, tapping stone witch 
once, statue¡¯s hump opened wide enough admit fairly thin person 
harry glanced quickly corridor, tucked map away again, hoisted hole headfirst, pushed forward 
slid considerable way felt like stone slide, landed cold, damp earth 
stood up, looking around 
pitch dark 
held wand, muttered, ¡° lumosy ¡¯ saw narrow, low, earthy passageway 
raised map, tapped tip wand, muttered, ¡°mischief managed!¡± map went blank 
folded carefully, tucked inside robes, then, heart beating fast, excited apprehensive, set 
passage twisted turned, like burrow giant rabbit anything else 
harry hurried along it, stumbling uneven floor, holding wand front 
took ages, harry thought honeydukes sustain 
felt like hour, passage began rise 
panting, harry sped up, face hot, feet cold 
ten minutes later, came foot worn stone steps, rose sight 
careful make noise, harry began climb 
hundred steps, two hundred steps, lost count climbed, watching feet 


then, without warning, head hit something hard 
seemed trapdoor 
harry stood there, massaging top head, listening 
couldn¡¯t hear sounds 
slowly, pushed trapdoor open peered edge 
cellar, full wooden crates boxes 
harry climbed trapdoor replaced ¡ª blended perfectly dusty floor impossible tell 
harry crept slowly toward wooden staircase led upstairs 
could definitely hear voices, mention tinkle bell opening shutting door 
wondering ought do, suddenly heard door open much closer hand; somebody come downstairs 
¡°and get another box jelly slugs, dear, they¡¯ve nearly cleaned us ¡ª ¡± said woman¡¯s voice 
pair feet coming staircase 
harry leapt behind enormous crate waited footsteps pass 
heard man shifting boxes opposite wall 
might get another chance ¡ª quickly silently, harry dodged hiding place climbed stairs; looking back, saw enormous backside shiny bald head, buried box 
harry reached door top stairs, slipped it, found behind counter honey dukes ¡ª ducked, crept sideways, straightened 
honeydukes crowded hogwarts students one looked twice harry 
edged among them, looking around, suppressed laugh imagined look would spread dudley¡¯s piggy face could see harry 
shelves upon shelves succulent-looking sweets imaginable 
creamy chunks nougat, shimmering pink squares coconut ice, fat, honey-colored toffees; hundreds different kinds chocolate neat rows; large barrel every flavor beans, another fizzing whizbees, levitating sherbet balls ron mentioned; along yet another wall ¡®special effects¡¯ ¡ª sweets: droobles best blowing gum (which filled room bluebell-colored bubbles refused pop days), strange, splintery toothflossing stringmints, tiny black pepper imps (¡®breathe fire friends!¡¯), ice mice (¡®hear teeth chatter squeak!¡¯), peppermint creams shaped like toads (¡®hop realistically stomach!¡¯), fragile sugar-spun quills, exploding bonbons 
harry squeezed crowd sixth years saw sign hanging farthest comer shop (unusual tastes) 
ron hermione standing underneath it, examining tray blood-flavored lollipops 
harry sneaked behind 
¡°ugh, no, harry won¡¯t want one those, they¡¯re vampires, expect,¡± hermione saying 
¡°how these?¡± said ron, shoving ajar cockroach clusters hennione¡¯s nose 
¡°definitely not,¡± said harry 
ron nearly dropped jar 
¡° harryv ¡¯ squealed hermione 
¡°what here? ¡ª ¡ª ?¡± ¡°wow!¡± said ron, looking impressed, ¡°you¡¯ve learned apparate!¡± ¡®¡°course haven¡¯t,¡± said harry 
dropped voice none sixth years could hear told marauder¡¯s map 
¡°how come fred george never gave tome!¡± said ron, outraged 
¡°i¡¯m brother!¡± ¡°but harry isn¡¯t going keep it!¡± said hermione, though idea ludicrous 
¡°he¡¯s going hand professor mcgonagall, aren¡¯t you, harry?¡± ¡°no, i¡¯m not!¡± said harry 
¡°are mad?¡± said ron, goggling hermione 
¡°hand something good?¡± ¡°if hand in, i¡¯ll say got it! filch would know fred george nicked it!¡± ¡°but sirius black?¡± hermione hissed 
¡°he could using one passages map get castle! teachers got know!¡± ¡°he can¡¯t getting passage,¡± said harry quickly 
¡°there seven secret tunnels map, right? fred george reckon filch already knows four 
three ¡ª one them¡¯s caved in, one get 
one them¡¯s got whomping willow planted entrance, can¡¯t get 
one came ¡ª well ¡ª it¡¯s really hard see entrance cellar ¡ª unless knew ¡ª ¡± harry hesitated 
black know passage there? ron, however, cleared throat significantly, pointed notice pasted inside sweetshop door

therefore advisable complete shopping well nightfall 
merry christmas! ¡°see?¡± said ron quietly 
¡°i¡¯d like see black try break honeydukes dementors swarming village 
anyway, hennione, honeydukes owners would hear break- in, wouldn¡¯t they? live shop!¡± ¡°yes, ¡ª ¡ª ¡± heroine seemed struggling find another problem

¡°come on, hennione, it¡¯s christmas 
harry deserves break 
¡± hennione bit lip, looking extremely worried 
¡°are going report me?¡± harry asked her, grinning 
¡°oh ¡ª course ¡ª honestly, harry ¡ª ¡± ¡°seen fizzing whizbees, hany?¡± said ron, grabbing leading banel 
¡°and jelly slugs? acid pops? fred gave one seven ¡ª burnt hole right tongue

¡± ron stared broodingly acid pop box 
¡°reckon fred¡¯d take bite cockroach cluster told peanuts?¡± ron hennione paid sweets, three left honeydukes blizzard outside 
hogsmeade looked like christmas card; little thatched cottages shops covered layer crisp snow; holly wreaths doors strings enchanted candles hanging trees 
harry shivered; unlike two, didn¡¯t cloak 
headed street, heads bowed wind, ron hennione shouting scarves 
¡°that¡¯s post office ¡ª ¡± ¡°zonko¡¯s ¡ª ¡± ¡°we could go shrieking shack ¡ª ¡± ¡°tell what,¡± said ron, teeth chattering, ¡°shall go butterbeer three broomsticks?¡± harry willing; wind fierce hands freezing, crossed road, minutes entering tiny inn 
extremely crowded, noisy, warm, smoky 
curvy sort woman pretty face serving bunch rowdy warlocks bar 
¡°that¡¯s madam rosmerta,¡± said ron 
¡°i¡¯ll get drinks, shall i?¡± added, going slightly red 
harry hermione made way back room, small, vacant table window handsome christmas tree, stood next fireplace 
ron came back five minutes later, carrying three foaming tankards hot butterbeer 
¡°merry christmas!¡± said happily, raising tankard 
harry drank deeply 
delicious thing he¡¯d ever tasted seemed heat every bit inside 
sudden breeze ruffled hair 
door three broomsticks opened 
harry looked rim tankard choked 
professors mcgonagall flitwick entered pub flurry snowflakes, shortly followed hagrid, deep conversation portly man lime-green bowler hat pinstriped cloak ¡ª cornelius fudge, minister magic 
instant, ron hermione placed hands top harry¡¯s head forced stool table

somewhere him, hermione whispered, ¡° mobiliarbusv ¡¯ christmas tree beside table rose inches ground, drifted sideways, landed soft thump right front table, hiding view 
staring dense lower branches, harry saw four sets chair legs move back table right beside theirs, heard grunts sighs teachers minister sat 
next saw another pair feet, wearing sparkly turquoise high heels, heard woman¡¯s voice 
¡°a small gillywater ¡ª ¡± ¡°mine,¡± said professor mcgonagall¡¯s voice 
¡°four pints mulled mead ¡ª ¡± ¡°ta, rosmerta,¡± said hagrid

¡°of people go dark side, sirius black last i¡¯d thought

¡± second man¡¯s voice changed 
started making noises frank never heard before; hissing spitting without drawing breath 
frank thought must sort fit seizure 
frank heard movement behind dark passageway 
turned look, found paralyzed fright 
something slithering toward along dark corridor floor, drew nearer sliver firelight, realized thrill terror gigantic snake, least twelve feet long 
horrified, transfixed, frank stared undulating body cut wide, curving track thick dust floor, coming closer closer ¡ª do? means escape room two men sat plotting murder, yet stayed snake would surely kill ¡ª made decision, snake level him, then, incredibly, miraculously, passing; following spitting, hissing noises made cold voice beyond door, seconds, tip diamond-patterned tail vanished gap- sweat frank¡¯s forehead now, hand walking stick trembling 
inside room, cold voice continuing hiss, frank visited strange idea, impossible idea 


man could talk snakes 
frank didn¡¯t understand going 
wanted anything back bed hot-water bottle 
problem legs didn¡¯t seem want move 
stood shaking trying master himself, cold voice switched abruptly english 
¡°nagini interesting news, wormtail,¡± said 
¡°in-indeed, lord?¡± said wonntail 
¡°indeed, yes,¡± said voice, ¡°according nagini, old muggle standing right outside room, listening every word say

snake, hand, curled rotting hearth rug, like horrible travesty pet dog 
wormtail beckoned frank room 
though still deeply shaken, frank took firmer grip walking stick limped threshold 
fire source light room; cast long, spidery shadows upon walls 
frank stared back armchair; man inside seemed even smaller servant, frank couldn¡¯t even see back head 
¡°you heard everything, muggle?¡± said cold voice 
¡°what¡¯s you¡¯re calling me?¡± said frank defiantly, inside room, time come sort action, felt braver; always war

¡°i much, much man

wormtail, come turn chair around 
¡± servant gave whimper 
¡°you heard me, wormtail 
¡± slowly, face screwed up, though would rather done anything approach master hearth rug snake lay, small man walked forward began turn chair 
snake lifted ugly triangular head hissed slightly legs chair snagged rug 
chair facing frank, saw sitting 
walking stick fell floor clatter 
opened mouth let scream 
screaming loudly never heard words thing chair spoke raised wand 
flash green light, rushing sound, frank bryce crumpled 
dead hit floor 
two hundred miles away, boy called harry potter woke start 
chapter two scar harry lay flat back, breathing hard though running 
awoken vivid dream hands pressed face 
old scar forehead, shaped like bolt lightning, burning beneath fingers though someone pressed white-hot wire skin 
sat up, one hand still scar, hand reaching darkness glasses, bedside table 
put bedroom came clearer focus, lit faint, misty orange light filtering curtains street lamp outside window 
harry ran fingers scar 
still painful 
turned lamp beside him, scrambled bed, crossed room, opened wardrobe, peered mirror inside door 
skinny boy fourteen looked back him, bright green eyes puzzled untidy black hair 
examined lightning-bolt scar reflection closely 
looked normal, still stinging 
harry tried recall dreaming awoken 
seemed real 


two people knew one didn¡¯t 


concentrated hard, frowning, trying remember 


dim picture darkened room came 


snake hearth rug 


small man called peter, nicknamed wormtail 


cold, high voice 


voice lord voldemort 
harry felt though ice cube slipped stomach thought 


closed eyes tightly tried remember voldemort looked like, impossible 


harry knew moment voldemort¡¯ chair swung around, he, harry, seen sitting it, felt spasm horror, awoken 


pain scar? old man been? definitely old man; harry watched fall ground 
becoming confused 
harry put face hands, blocking bedroom, trying hold picture dimly lit room, like trying keep water cupped hands; details trickling away fast tried hold 


voldemort wormtail talking someone killed, though harry could remember name 


plotting kill someone else 


him! harry took face hands, opened eyes, stared around bedroom though expecting see something unusual 
happened, extraordinary number unusual things room 
large wooden trunk stood open foot bed, revealing cauldron, broomstick, black robes, assorted spellbooks 
rolls parchment littered part desk taken large, empty cage snowy owl, hedwig, usually perched 
floor beside bed book lay open; harry reading fell asleep last night 
pictures book moving 
men bright orange robes zooming sight broomsticks, throwing red ball one another 
harry walked book, picked up, watched wizards score spectacular goal putting ball fi fly- foot-high hoop 
snapped book shut 
even quidditch ¡ª harry¡¯s opinion, best sport world ¡ª couldn¡¯t distract moment 
placed flying cannons bedside table, crossed window, drew back curtains survey street 
privet drive looked exactly respectable suburban street would expected look early hours saturday morning 
curtains closed 
far harry could see darkness, wasn¡¯t living creature sight, even cat 
yet 


yet 


harry went restlessly back bed sat it, running finger scar 
wasn¡¯t pain bothered him; harry stranger pain injury 
lost bones right arm painfully regrown night 
arm pierced venomous foot-long fang long afterward 
last year harry fallen fifty feet airborn broomstick 
used bizarre accidents injuries; unavoidable attended hogwarts school witchcraft wizardry knack attracting lot trouble 
no, thing bothering harry last time scar hurt him, voldemort close 


voldemort couldn¡¯t here, 


idea voldemort lurking privet drive absurd, impossible 


harry listened closely silence around 
half expecting hear creak stair swish cloak? jumped slightly heard cousin dudley give tremendous grunting snore next room 
harry shook mentally ; stupid 
one house except uncle vernon, aunt petunia, dudley, plainly still asleep, dreams untroubled painless 
asleep way harry liked dursleys best; wasn¡¯t though ever help awake 
uncle vernon, aunt petunia, dudley harry¡¯s living relatives 
muggles hated despised magic form, meant harry welcome house dry rot 
explained away harry¡¯s long absences hogwarts last three years telling everyone went st 
brutus¡¯s secure center incurably criminal boys 
knew perfectly well that, underage wizard, harry wasn¡¯t allowed use magic outside hogwarts, still apt blame anything went wrong house 
harry never able confide tell anything life wizarding world 
idea going awoke, telling scar hurting him, worries voldemort, laughable 
yet voldemort harry come live dursleys first place 
hadn¡¯t voldemort, harry would lightning scar forehead 
hadn¡¯t voldemort, harry would still parents 


harry year old night voldemort ¡ª powerful dark wizard century, wizard gaining power steadily eleven years ¡ª arrived house killed father mother 
voldemort turned wand harry; performed curse disposed many full-grown witches wizards steady rise power ¡ª and, incredibly, worked 
instead killing small boy, curse rebounded upon voldemort 
harry survived nothing lightning-shaped cut forehead, voldemort reduced something barely alive 
powers gone, life almost extinguished, voldemort fled; terror secret community witches wizards lived long lifted, voldemort¡¯s followers disbanded, harry potter become famous 
enough shock harry discover, eleventh birthday, wizard; even disconcerting find everyone hidden wizarding world knew name 
harry arrived hogwarts find heads turned whispers followed wherever went 
used now: end summer, would starting fourth year hogwarts, harry already counting days would back castle 
still fortnight go went back school 
looked hopelessly around room again, eye paused birthday cards two best friends sent end july 
would say harry wrote told scar hurting? once, hermione granger¡¯s voice seemed fill head, shrill panicky 
¡°your scar hurt? harry, that¡¯s really serious 


write professor dumbledore! i¡¯ll go check common magical ailments afflictions 


maybe there¡¯s something curse scars 


¡± yes, would hermione¡¯s advice: go straight headmaster hogwarts, meantime, consult book 
harry stared window inky blue-black sky 
doubted much whether book could help 
far knew, living person survived curse like voldemort¡¯s; highly unlikely, therefore, would find symptoms listed common magical ailments afflictions 
informing headmaster, harry idea dumbledore went summer holidays 
amused moment, picturing dumbledore, long silver beard, full length wizard¡¯s robes, pointed hat, stretched beach somewhere, rubbing suntan lotion onto long crooked nose 
wherever dumbledore was, though, harry sure hedwig would able find him; harry¡¯s owl never yet failed deliver letter anyone, even without address 
would write? dear professor dumbledore, sorry bother you, scar hurt morning 
sincerely, harry potter 
even inside head words sounded stupid 
tried imagine best friend, ron weasley¡¯s, reaction, moment, ron¡¯s red hair long-nosed, freckled face seemed swim harry, wearing bemused expression 
¡°your scar hurt? 


you-know-who can¡¯t near now, he? mean 


you¡¯d know, wouldn¡¯t you? he¡¯d trying again, wouldn¡¯t be? dunno, harry, maybe curse scars always twinge bit 


i¡¯ll ask dad 


¡± mr 
weasley fully qualified wizard worked misuse muggle artifacts office ministry magic, didn¡¯t particular expertise matter curses, far harry knew 
case, harry didn¡¯t like idea whole weasley family knowing he, harry, getting jumpy moments¡¯ pain 
mrs 
weasley would fuss worse hermione, fred george, ron¡¯s sixteen- year-old twin brothers, might think harry losing nerve 
weasleys harry¡¯s favorite family world; hoping might invite stay time (ron mentioned something quidditch world cup), somehow didn¡¯t want visit punctuated anxious inquiries scar 
harry kneaded forehead kn uckles 
really wanted (and felt almost shameful admit himself) someone like - someone like parent: adult wizard whose advice could ask without feeling stupid, someone cared him, experience dark magic 


solution came 
simple, obvious, couldn¡¯t believe taken long - sirius 
harry leapt bed, hurried across room, sat desk; pulled piece parchment toward him, loaded eagle-feather quill ink, wrote dear sirius, paused, wondering best phrase problem, still marveling fact hadn¡¯t thought sirius straight away 
then, perhaps wasn¡¯t surprising - all, found sirius godfather two months ago 
simple reason sirius¡¯s complete absence harry¡¯s life - sirius azkaban, terrifying wizard jail guarded creatures called dementors, sightless, soul-sucking fiends come search sirius hogwarts escaped 
yet sirius innocent - murders convicted committed wormtail, voldemort¡¯s supporter, nearly everybody believed dead 
harry, ron, hermione knew otherwise, however; come face-to-face wormtail previous year, though professor dumbledore believed story 
one glorious hour, harry believed leaving dursleys last, sirius offered home name cleared 
chance snatched away - wormtail escaped could take ministry magic, sirius flee life 
harry helped escape back hippogriff called buckbeak, since then, sirius run 
home harry might wormtail escaped haunting summer 
doubly hard return dursleys knowing nearly escaped forever 
nevertheless, sirius help harry, even couldn¡¯t 
due sirius harry school things bedroom 
dursleys never allowed before; general wish keeping harry miserable possible, coupled fear powers, led lock school trunk cupboard stairs every summer prior 
attitude changed since found harry dangerous murderer godfather - harry conveniently forgotten tell sirius innocent 
harry received two letters sirius since back privet drive 
delivered, owls (as usual wizards), large, brightly colored tropical birds 
hedwig approved flashy intruders; reluctant allow drink water tray flying 
harry, hand, liked them; put mind palm trees white sand, hoped that, wherever sirius (sirius never said, case letters intercepted), enjoying 
somehow, harry found hard imaging dementors surviving long bright sunlight, perhaps sirius gone south 
sirius¡¯s letters, hidden beneath highly useful loose floorboards harry¡¯s bed, sounded cheerful, reminded harry call ever harry needed 
well, needed right now, right 


harry¡¯s lamp seemed grow dimmer cold gray light precedes sunrise slowly crept room 
finally, sun risen, bedroom walls turned gold, sounds movement could heard uncle vernon aunt petunia¡¯s room, harry cleared desk crumpled pieces parchment reread finished letter 
dear sirius, thanks last letter 
bird enormous; could hardly get window 
things usual 
dudley's diet going well 
aunt found smuggling doughnuts room yesterday 
told they'd cut pocket money keeps it, got really angry chucked playstation window 
that's sort computer thing play games 
bit stupid really, even got mega- mutilation part three take mind things 
i'm okay, mainly dursleys terrified might turn turn bats ask 
weird thing happened morning, though 
scar hurt 
last time happened voldemort hogwarts 
reckon anywhere near now, he? know curse scars sometimes hurt years afterward? ril send hedwig gets back; hunting moment 
say hello buckbeak 
harry yes, thought harry, looked right 
point putting dream; didn¡¯t want look though worried 
folded parchment laid aside desk, ready hedwig returned 
got feet, stretched, opened wardrobe 
without glancing reflection started get dressed going breakfast 
chapter three invitation time harry arrived kitchen, three dursleys already seated around table 
none looked entered sat 
uncle vernon¡¯s large red face hidden behind morning¡¯s daily mail, aunt petunia cutting grapefruit quarters, lips pursed horselike teeth 
dudley looked furious sulky, somehow seemed taking even space usual 
saying something, always took entire side square table 
aunt petunia put quarter unsweetened grapefruit onto dudley¡¯s plate tremulous ¡°there are, diddy darling,¡± dudley glowered 
life taken unpleasant turn since come home summer end-of-year report 
uncle vernon aunt petunia managed find excuses bad marks usual: aunt petunia always insisted dudley gifted boy whose teachers didn¡¯t understand him, uncle vernon maintained ¡°he didn¡¯t want swotty little nancy boy son anyway 
¡± also skated accusations bullying report - ¡°he¡¯s boisterous little boy, wouldn¡¯t hurt fly!¡± aunt petunia said tearfully 
however, bottom report well-chosen comments school nurse even uncle vernon aunt petunia could explain away 
matter much aunt petunia wailed dudley big-boned, poundage really puppy fat, growing boy needed plenty food, fact remained school outfitters didn¡¯t stock knickerbockers big enough anymore 
school nurse seen aunt petunia¡¯s eyes - sharp came spotting fingerprints gleaming walls, observing comings goings neighbors - simply refused see: far needing extra nourishment, dudley reached roughly size weight young killer whale 
- many tantrums, arguments shook harry¡¯s bedroom floor, many tears aunt petunia - new regime begun 
diet sheet sent smeltings school nurse taped fridge, emptied dudley¡¯s favorite things - fizzy drinks cakes, chocolate bars burgers filled instead fruit vegetables sorts things uncle vernon called ¡°rabbit food 
¡± make dudley feel better all, aunt petunia insisted whole family follow diet 
passed grapefruit quarter harry 
noticed lot smaller dudley¡¯s 
aunt petunia seemed feel best way keep dudley¡¯s morale make sure did, least, get eat harry 
aunt petunia didn¡¯t kn ow hidden loose floorboard upstairs 
idea harry following diet 
moment got wind fact expected survive summer carrot sticks, harry sent hedwig friends pleas help, risen occasion magnificently 
hedwig returned hermione¡¯s house large box stuffed full sugar-free snacks 
(hermione¡¯s parents dentists 
) hagrid, hogwarts gamekeeper, obliged sack full homemade rock cakes 
(harry hadn¡¯t touched these; much experience hagrid¡¯s cooking 
) mrs 
weasley, however, sent family owl, errol, enormous fruitcake assorted meat pies 
poor errol, elderly feeble, needed full five days recover journey 
harry¡¯s birthday (which dursleys completely ignored) received four superb birthday cakes, one ron, hermione, hagrid, sirius 
harry still two left, so, looking forward real breakfast got back upstairs, ate grapefruit without complaint 
uncle vernon laid aside paper deep sniff disapproval looked grapefruit quarter 
¡°is it?¡± said grumpily aunt petunia 
aunt petunia gave severe look, nodded pointedly dudley, already finished grapefruit quarter eyeing harry¡¯s sour look piggy little eyes 
uncle vernon gave great sigh, ruffled large, bushy mustache, picked spoon 
doorbell rang 
uncle vernon heaved chair set hall 
quick flash, mother occupied kettle, dudley stole rest uncle vernon¡¯s grapefruit 
harry heard talking door, someone laughing, uncle vernon answering curtly 
front door closed, sound ripping paper came hall 
aunt petunia set teapot table looked curiously around see uncle vernon got 
didn¡¯t wait long find out; minute, back 
looked livid 
¡°you,¡± barked harry 
¡°in living room 

¡± bewildered, wondering earth supposed done time, harry got followed uncle vernon kitchen next room 
uncle vernon closed door sharply behind 
¡°so,¡± said, marching fireplace turning face harry though pronounce arrest 
¡°so 
¡± harry would dearly loved said, ¡°so what?¡± didn¡¯t feel uncle vernon¡¯s temper tested early morning, especially already severe strain lack food 
therefore settled looking politely puzzled 
¡°this arrived,¡± said uncle vernon 
brandished piece purple writing paper harry 
¡°a letter 

¡± harry¡¯s confusion increased 
would writing uncle vernon him? know sent letters postman? uncle vernon glared harry, looked letter began read aloud: dear mr 
mrs 
dursley, never introduced, sure heard great deal harry son ron 
harry might told you, final quidditch world cup takes place monday night, husband, arthur, managed get prime tickets connections department magical games sports 
hope allow us take harry match, really once-in-a lifetime opportunity; britain hosted cup thirty years, tickets extremely hard come 
would course glad harry stay remainder summer holidays, see safely onto train back school 
would best harry send us answer quickly possible normal way, muggle postman never delivered house, sure even knows 
hoping see harry soon, sincerely, molly weasley p 

hope we've put enough stamps 
uncle vernon finished reading, put hand back breast pocket, drew something else 
¡°look this,¡± growled 
held envelope mrs 
weasley¡¯s letter come, harry fight laugh 
every bit covered stamps except square inch front, mrs 
weasley squeezed dursleys¡¯ address minute writing 
¡°she put enough stamps on, then,¡± said harry, trying sound though mrs 
weasley¡¯s mistake anyone could make 
uncle¡¯s eyes flashed 
¡°the postman noticed,¡± said gritted teeth 
¡°very interested kn ow letter came from, 
that¡¯s rang doorbell 
seemed think funny 
¡± harry didn¡¯t say anything 
people might understand uncle vernon making fuss many stamps, harry lived dursleys long know touchy anything even slightly ordinary 
worst fear someone would find connected (however distantly) people like mrs 
weasley 
uncle vernon still glaring harry, tried keep expression neutral 
didn¡¯t say anything stupid, might treat lifetime 
waited uncle vernon say something, merely continued glare 
harry decided break silence 
¡°so - go then?¡± asked 
slight spasm crossed uncle vernon¡¯s large purple face 
mustache bristled 
harry thought knew going behind mustache: furious battle two uncle vernon¡¯s fundamental instincts came conflict 
allowing harry go would make harry happy, something uncle vernon struggled thirteen years 
hand, allowing harry disappear weasleys¡¯ rest summer would get rid two weeks earlier anyone could hoped, uncle vernon hated harry house 
give thinking time, seemed, looked mrs 
weasley¡¯s letter 
¡°who woman?¡± said, staring signature distaste 
¡°you¡¯ve seen her,¡± said harry 
¡°she¡¯s friend ron¡¯s mother, meeting hog - school train end last term 
¡± almost said ¡°hogwarts express,¡± sure way get uncle¡¯s temper 
nobody ever mentioned name harry¡¯s school aloud dursley household 
uncle vernon screwed enonnous face though trying remember something unpleasant 
¡°dumpy sort woman?¡± growled finally 
¡°load children red hair?¡± harry frowned 
thought bit rich uncle vernon call anyone ¡°dumpy,¡± son, dudley, finally achieved he¡¯d threatening since age three, become wider tall 
uncle vernon perusing letter 
¡°quidditch,¡± muttered breath 
¡°quidditch - rubbish?¡± harry felt second stab annoyance 
¡°it¡¯s sport,¡± said shortly 
¡°played broom- ¡° ¡°all right, right!¡± said uncle vernon loudly 
harry saw, satisfaction, uncle looked vaguely panicky 
apparently nerves couldn¡¯t stand sound word ¡°broomsticks¡± living room 
took refuge perusing letter 
harry saw lips form words ¡°send us answer 


normal way 
¡± scowled 
¡°what mean, ¡®the normal way¡¯?¡± spat 
¡°normal us,¡± said harry, uncle could stop him, added, ¡°you know, owl post 
that¡¯s what¡¯s normal wizards 
¡± uncle vernon looked outraged harry uttered disgusting swearword 
shaking anger, shot nervous look window, though expecting see neighbors ears pressed glass 
¡°how many times tell mention unnaturalness roof?¡± hissed, face rich plum color 
¡°you stand there, clothes petunia put ungrateful back ¡°only dudley finished them,¡± said harry coldly, indeed, dressed sweatshirt large roll back sleeves five times able use hands, fell past knees extremely baggy jeans 
¡°i spoken like that!¡± said uncle vernon, trembling rage 
harry wasn¡¯t going stand 
gone days forced take every single one dursleys¡¯ stupid rules 
wasn¡¯t following dudley¡¯s diet, wasn¡¯t going let uncle vernon stop going quidditch world cup, could help 
harry took deep, steadying breath said, ¡°okay, can¡¯t see world cup 
go now, then? i¡¯ve got letter sirius want finish 
know - godfather 
¡± done it, said magic words 
watched purple recede blotchily uncle vernon¡¯s face, making look like badly mixed black currant ice cream 
¡°you¡¯re - you¡¯re writing him, you?¡± said uncle vernon, would-be calm voice - harry seen pupils tiny eyes contract sudden fear 
¡°well - yeah,¡± said harry, casually 
¡°it¡¯s since heard me, and, know, doesn¡¯t might start thinking something¡¯s wrong 
¡± stopped enjoy effect words 
could almost see cogs working uncle vernon¡¯s thick, dark, neatly parted hair 
tried stop harry writing sirius, sirius would think harry mistreated 
told harry couldn¡¯t go quidditch world cup, harry would write tell sirius, would know harry mistreated 
one thing uncle vernon 
harry could see conclusion forming uncle¡¯s mind though great mustached face transparent 
harry tried smile, keep face blank possible 
- ¡°well, right 
go ruddy 


stupid 


world cup thing 
write tell - weasleys they¡¯re pick up, mind 
haven¡¯t got time go dropping country 
spend rest summer 
tell - godfather 


tell 


tell you¡¯re going 
¡± ¡°okay then,¡± said harry brightly 
turned walked toward living room door, fighting urge jump air whoop 
going 


going weasleys¡¯, going watch quidditch world cup! outside hall nearly ran dudley, lurking behind door, clearly hoping overhear harry told 
looked shocked see broad grin harry¡¯s face 
¡°that excellent breakfast, wasn¡¯t it?¡± said harry 
¡°i feel really full, don¡¯t you?¡± laughing astonished look dudley¡¯s face, harry took stairs three time, hurled back bedroom 
first thing saw hedwig back 
sitting cage, staring harry enonnous amber eyes, clicking beak way meant annoyed something 
exactly annoying became apparent almost 
¡°ouch!¡± said harry appeared small, gray, feathery tennis ball collided side head 
harry massaged spot furiously, looking see hit him, saw minute owl, small enough fit palm hand, whizzing excitedly around room like loose firework 
harry realized owl dropped letter feet 
harry bent down, recognized ron¡¯s handwriting, tore open envelope 
inside hastily scribbled note 
harry - dad got tickets - ireland versus bulgaria, monday night 
mum's writing muggles ask stay 
might already letter, know fast muggle post 
thought i'd send pig anyway 
harry stared word ¡°pig,¡± looked tiny owl zooming around light fixture ceiling 
never seen anything looked less like pig 
maybe couldn¡¯t read ron¡¯s writing 
went back letter: we're coming whether muggles like not, can't miss world cup, mum dad reckon better pretend ask permission first 
say yes, send pig back answer pronto, we'll come get five o'clock sunday 
say no, send pig back pronto we'll come get five o'clock sunday anyway 
hermione's arriving afternoon 
percy's started work - department international magical cooperation 
't mention anything abroad unless want pants bored 
see soon - ron ¡°calm down!¡± harry said small owl flew low head, twittering madly harry could assume pride delivered letter right person 
¡°come here, need take answer back!¡± owl fluttered top hedwig¡¯s cage 
hedwig looked coldly it, though daring try come closer 
harry seized eagle-feather quill more, grabbed fresh piece parchment, wrote: ron, okay, muggles say come 
see five o'clock tomorrow 
can't wait 
harry folded note small, immense difficulty, tied tiny owl¡¯s leg hopped spot excitement 
moment note secure, owl again; zoomed window sight 
harry turned hedwig 
¡°feeling long journey?¡± asked 
hedwig hooted dignified sort way 
¡°can take sirius me?¡± said, picking letter 
¡°hang 


want finish 
¡± unfolded parchment hastily added postscript 
want contact me, i'll friend ron weasley's rest summer 
dad's got us tickets quidditch world cup! letter finished, tied hedwig¡¯s leg; kept unusually still, though determined show real post owl behave 
¡°i¡¯ll ron¡¯s get back, right?¡± harry told 
nipped linger affectionately, then, soft swooshing noise, spread enormous wings soared open window 
harry watched sight, crawled bed, wrenched loose floorboard, pulled large chunk birthday cake 
sat floor eating it, savoring happiness flooding 
cake, dudley nothing grapefruit; bright summer¡¯s day, would leaving privet drive tomorrow, scar felt perfectly normal again, going watch quidditch world cup 
hard, now, feel worried anything - even lord voldemort 
chapter four back burrow twelve o¡¯clock next day, harry¡¯s school tru nk packed school things prized possessions - invisibility cloak inherited father, broomstick gotten sirius, enchanted map hogwarts given fred george weasley last year 
emptied hiding place loose floorboard food, double-checked every nook cranny bedroom forgotten spellbooks quills, taken chart wall counting days september first, liked cross days remaining return hogwarts 
atmosphere inside number four, privet drive extremely tense 
imminent arrival house assortment wizards making dursleys uptight irritable 
uncle vernon looked downright alarmed harry informed weasleys would arriving five o¡¯clock next day 
¡°i hope told dress properly, people,¡± snarled 
¡°i¡¯ve seen sort stuff lot wear 
they¡¯d better decency put normal clothes, that¡¯s 
¡± harry felt slight sense foreboding 
rarely seen mr 
mrs 
weasley wearing anything dursleys would call ¡°normal 
¡± children might muggle clothing holidays, mr 
mrs 
weasley usually wore long robes varying states shabbiness 
harry wasn¡¯t bothered neighbors would think, anxious rude dursleys might weasleys turned looking like worst idea wizards 
uncle vernon put best suit 
people, might looked like gesture welcome, harry knew uncle vernon wanted look impressive intimidating 
dudley, hand, looked somehow diminished 
diet last taking effect, due fright 
dudley emerged last encounter fully grown wizard curly pig¡¯s tail poking seat trousers, aunt petunia uncle vernon pay removal private hospital london 
wasn¡¯t altogether surprising, therefore, dudley kept running hand nervously backside, walking sideways room room, present target enemy 
lunch almost silent meal 
dudley didn¡¯t even protest food (cottage cheese grated celery) 
aunt petunia wasn¡¯t, eating anything 
arms folded, lips pursed, seemed chewing tongue, though biting back furious diatribe longed throw harry 
¡°they¡¯ll driving, course?¡± uncle vernon barked across table 
¡°er,¡± said harry 
hadn¡¯t thought 
weasleys going pick up? didn¡¯t car anymore; old ford anglia owned currently running wild forbidden forest hogwarts 
mr 
weasley borrowed ministry magic car last year; possibly would today? ¡°i think so,¡± said harry 
uncle vernon snorted mustache 
normally, uncle vernon would asked car mr 
weasley drove; tended judge men big expensive cars 
harry doubted whether uncle vernon would taken mr 
weasley even drove ferrari 
harry spent afternoon bedroom; couldn¡¯t stand watching aunt petunia peer net curtains every seconds, though warning escaped rhinoceros 
finally, quarter five, harry went back downstairs living room 
aunt petunia compulsively straightening cushions 
uncle vernon pretending read paper, tiny eyes moving, harry sure really listening might sound approaching car 
dudley crammed annchair, porky hands beneath him, clamped firmly around bottom 
harry couldn¡¯t take tension; left room went sat stairs hall, eyes watch heart pumping fast excitement nerves 
five o¡¯clock came went 
uncle vernon, perspiring slightly suit, opened front door, peered street, withdrew head quickly 
¡°they¡¯re late!¡± snarled harry 
¡°i know,¡± said harry

¡°if muggle looks it, see moldering old ruin sign entrance saying danger, enter, unsafe 
¡± ¡°so durmstrang¡¯ll look like ruin outsider too?¡± ¡°maybe,¡± said hermione, shrugging, ¡°or might muggle-repelling charms it, like world cup stadium 
keep foreign wizards finding it, they¡¯ll made unplottable ¡°come again?¡± ¡°well, enchant building it¡¯s impossible plot map, can¡¯t you?¡± ¡°er

talking professor sinistra astronomy department 
professor sinistra¡¯s side sallow-faced, hook-nosed, greasy-haired potions master, snape - harry¡¯s least favorite person hogwarts 
harry¡¯s loathing snape matched snape¡¯s hatred him, hatred had, possible, intensified last year, harry helped sirius escape right snape¡¯s overlarge nose - snape sirius enemies since school days

crookshanks wandered them, leapt lightly empty chair, stared inscrutably harry, rather hermione might look knew weren¡¯t homework properly 
staring around room, trying think kind misfortune hadn¡¯t yet used, harry saw fred george sitting together opposite wall, heads together, quills out, poring single piece parchment 
unusual see fred george hidden away comer working silently; usually liked thick things noisy center attention 
something secretive way working piece parchment, harry reminded sat together writing something back burrow

¡°not going good month, you?¡± said sardonically crookshanks curled lap 
¡°ah well, least i¡¯m forewarned,¡± ron yawned 
¡°you seem drowning twice,¡± said hermione 
¡°oh i?¡± said ron, peering predictions 
¡°i¡¯d better change one getting trampled rampaging hippogriff

harry hastily untied sat read, whereupon hedwig fluttered onto knee, hooting softly 
¡°what say?¡± hennione asked breathlessly 
letter short, looked though scrawled great hurry 
harry read aloud: harry - i'm flying north immediately

sirius harry looked ron hennione, stared back 
¡°he¡¯s flying north?¡± hennione whispered 
¡°he¡¯s coming back?¡± ¡°dumbledore¡¯s reading signs?¡± said ron, looking perplexed 
¡°hany - what¡¯s up?¡± harry hit forehead fist, jolting hedwig lap

¡°it¡¯s made think he¡¯s got come back!¡± said hany, slamming list table hedwig landed back ron¡¯s chair, hooting indignantly 
¡°coming back, thinks i¡¯m trouble! there¡¯s nothing wrong me! haven¡¯t got anything you,¡± hany snapped hedwig, clicking beak expectantly, ¡°you¡¯ll go owlery want food 
¡± hedwig gave extremely offended look took open window, cuffing around head outstretched wing went 
¡°harry,¡± hennione began, pacifying sort voice 
¡°i¡¯m going bed,¡± said harry shortly

he¡¯d sense keep 
heard ron come dormitory short later, speak 
long time, harry lay staring dark canopy bed 
dormitory completely silent, and, less preoccupied, harry would realized absence neville¡¯s usual snores meant one lying awake 
chapter fifteen beauxbatons durmstrang early next morning, harry woke plan fully formed mind, though sleeping brain working night 
got up, dressed pale dawn light, left dormitory without waking ron, went back deserted common room 
took piece parchment table upon divination homework still lay wrote following letter: dear sirius, reckon imagined scar hurting, half asleep wrote last time 
there's point coming back, everything'¡¯ fine 
worry me, head feels completely normal 
harry climbed portrait hole, silent castle (held briefly peeves, tried overturn large vase halfway along fourth-floor corridor), finally arriving owlery, situated top west tower 
owlery circular stone room, rather cold drafty, none windows glass 
floor entirely covered straw, owl droppings, regurgitated skeletons mice voles 
hundreds upon hundreds owls every breed imaginable nestled perches rose right top tower, nearly asleep, though round amber eye glared harry 
spotted hedwig nestled bam owl tawny, hurried her, sliding little dropping-strewn floor 
took persuade wake look him, kept shuffling around perch, showing tail

¡°just find him, right?¡± harry said, stroking back carried arm one holes wall 
¡°before dementors 
¡± nipped finger, perhaps rather harder would ordinarily done, hooted softly reassuring sort way 
spread wings took sunrise 
harry watched fly sight familiar feeling unease back stomach 
sure sirius¡¯s reply would alleviate worries rather increasing

harry best worry sirius next couple weeks 
true, could stop looking anxiously around every morning post owls arrived, nor, late night went sleep, prevent seeing horrible visions sirius, cornered dementors dark london street, betweentimes tried keep mind godfather 
wished still quidditch distract him; nothing worked well troubled mind good, hard training session 
hand, lessons becoming difficult demanding ever before, particularly moody¡¯s defense dark arts 
surprise, professor moody announced would putting imperius curse turn, demonstrate power see whether could resist effects 
¡°but - said it¡¯s illegal, professor,¡± said hermione uncertainly moody cleared away desks sweep wand, leaving large clear space middle room 
¡°you said - use another human ¡°dumbledore wants taught feels like,¡± said moody, magical eye swiveling onto hennione fixing eerie, unblinking stare 
¡°if you¡¯d rather learn hard way - someone¡¯s putting control completely - fine 
you¡¯re excused

¡± pointed one gnarled finger toward door 
hennione went pink muttered something meaning wanted leave 
hany ron grinned 
knew hermione would rather eat bubotuber pus miss important lesson 
moody began beckon students forward turn put imperius curse upon 
harry watched as, one one, classmates extraordinary things influence 
dean thomas hopped three times around room, singing national anthem 
lavender brown imitated squirrel 
neville performed series quite astonishing gymnastics would certainly capable normal state 
one seemed able fight curse, recovered moody removed 
¡°potter,¡± moody growled, ¡°you next 
¡± harry moved forward middle classroom, space moody cleared desks 
moody raised wand, pointed harry, said, ¡°imperio!¡± wonderful feeling 
harry felt floating sensation every thought worry head wiped gently away, leaving nothing vague, untraceable happiness 
stood feeling immensely relaxed, dimly aware everyone watching 
heard mad-eye moody¡¯s voice, echoing distant chamber empty brain: jump onto desk

harry bent knees obediently, preparing spring 
jump onto desk 


why, though? another voice awoken back brain 
stupid thing do, really, said voice 
jump onto desk 


no, don¡¯t think will, thanks, said voice, little firmly 


no, don¡¯t really want

jumped tried prevent jumping - result he¡¯d smashed headlong desk knocking over, and, feeling legs, fractured kneecaps 
¡°now, that¡¯s like it!¡± growled moody¡¯s voice, suddenly, harry felt empty, echoing feeling head disappear 
remembered exactly happening, pain knees seemed double 
¡°look that, lot 


potter fought! fought it, damn near beat it! we¡¯ll try again, potter, rest you, pay attention - watch eyes, that¡¯s see - good, potter, good indeed! they¡¯ll trouble controlling you!¡± ¡°the way talks,¡± harry muttered hobbled defense dark arts class hour later (moody insisted putting harry paces four times row, harry could throw curse entirely), ¡°you¡¯d think going attacked second 
¡± ¡°yeah, know,¡± said ron, skipping every alternate step 
much difficulty curse harry, though moody assured effects would wear lunchtime 
¡°talk paranoid

¡°no wonder glad get shot ministry

¡°maybe not, thomas, believe me, need preparation get! miss granger remains person class managed turn hedgehog satisfactory pincushion

harry ron deeply amused professor trelawney told received top marks homework next divination class

malfoy flushed anger, apparently memory moody¡¯s punishment still sufficiently painful stop retorting 
harry, ron, hennione returned castle end lesson high spirits; seeing hagrid put malfoy particularly satisfying, especially malfoy done best get hagrid sacked previous year

¡± spoke though settled matter 
¡°you like he¡¯s handsome,¡± said ron scathingly 
¡°excuse me, don¡¯t like people they¡¯re handsome!¡± said hermione indignantly 
ron gave loud false cough, sounded oddly like ¡°lockhart!¡± appearance sign entrance hall marked effect upon inhabitants castle 
following week, seemed one topic conversation, matter harry went: triwizard tournament 
rumors flying student student like highly contagious germs: going try hogwarts champion, tournament would involve, students beauxbatons durmstrang differed 
harry noticed castle seemed undergoing extra-thorough cleaning 
several grimy portraits scrubbed, much displeasure subjects, sat huddled frames muttering darkly wincing felt raw pink faces 
suits armor suddenly gleaming moving without squeaking, argus filch, caretaker, behaving ferociously students forgot wipe shoes terrified pair first-year girls hysterics 
members staff seemed oddly tense 
¡°longbottom, kindly reveal can¡¯t even perform simple switching spell front anyone durmstrang!¡± professor mcgonagall barked end one particularly difficult lesson, neville accidentally transplanted ears onto cactus 
went breakfast morning thirtieth october, found great hall decorated overnight 
enormous silk banners hung walls, representing hogwarts house: red gold lion gryffiindor, blue bronze eagle ravenclaw, yellow black badger hufflepuff, green silver serpent slytherin 
behind teachers¡¯ table, largest banner bore hogwarts coat anns: lion, eagle, badger, snake united around large letter h 
harry, ron, hermione sat beside fred george gryffindor table 
again, unusually, sitting apart everyone else conversing low voices 
ron led way 
¡°it¡¯s bummer, right,¡± george saying gloomily fred 
¡°but won¡¯t talk us person, we¡¯ll send letter 
we¡¯ll stuff hand

¡°you know, bet could them, harry 
we¡¯ve done dangerous stuff 


¡± ¡°not front panel judges, haven¡¯t,¡± said fred 
¡°mcgonagall says champions get awarded points according well they¡¯ve done tasks 
¡± ¡°who judges?¡± harry asked 
¡°well, heads participating schools always panel,¡± said hennione, everyone looked around her, rather surprised, ¡°because three injured tournament 1792, cockatrice champions supposed catching went rampage

¡°house-elves!¡± said hennione, eyes flashing 
¡°not once, thousand pages, hogwarts, history mention colluding oppression hundred slaves!¡± harry shook head applied scrambled eggs

sickles wasted, however; anything, seemed made hennione vociferous 
badgering harry ron ever since, first wear badges, persuade others same, also taken rattling around gryffindor common room every evening, cornering people shaking collecting tin noses 
¡°you realize sheets changed, fires lit, classrooms cleaned, food cooked group magical creatures unpaid enslaved?¡± kept saying fiercely 
people, like neville, paid stop hennione glowering 
seemed mildly interested say, reluctant take active role campaigning 
many regarded whole thing joke 
ron rolled eyes ceiling, flooding autumn sunlight, fred became extremely interested bacon (both twins refused buy

george, however, leaned toward hennione 
¡°listen, ever kitchens, hennione?¡± ¡°no, course not,¡± said hennione curtly, ¡°i hardly think students supposed -¡± ¡°well, have,¡± said george, indicating fred, ¡°loads times, nick food 
we¡¯ve met them, they¡¯re happy 
think they¡¯ve got best job world -¡± ¡°that¡¯s they¡¯re uneducated brainwashed!¡± hermione began hotly, next words drowned sudden whooshing noise overhead, announced arrival post owls 
harry looked once, saw hedwig soaring toward 
hennione stopped talking abruptly; ron watched hedwig anxiously fluttered onto harry¡¯s shoulder, folded wings, held leg wearily 
harry pulled sirius¡¯s reply offered hedwig bacon rinds, ate gratefully 
then, checking fred george safely immersed discussions triwizard tournament, harry read sirius¡¯s letter whisper ron hennione 
nice try, harry 
i'm back country well hidden 
want keep posted everything that's going hogwarts 
use hedwig, keep changing owls, worry me, watch

sirius ¡°why d¡¯you keep changing owls?¡± ron asked low voice 
¡°hedwig¡¯ll attract much attention,¡± said hermione 
¡°she stands 
snowy owl keeps returning wherever he¡¯s hiding 


mean, they¡¯re native birds, they?¡± harry rolled letter slipped inside robes, wondering whether felt less wonied 
supposed sirius managing get back without caught something 
couldn¡¯t deny either idea sirius much nearer reassuring; least wouldn¡¯t wait long response every time wrote 
¡°thanks, hedwig,¡± said, stroking

pleasant feeling anticipation air day 
nobody attentive lessons, much interested arrival evening people beauxbatons durmstrang; even potions bearable usual, half hour shorter 
bell rang early, harry, ron, hermione hurried gryffindor tower, deposited bags books instructed, pulled cloaks, rushed back downstairs entrance hall 
heads houses ordering students lines 
¡°weasley, straighten hat,¡± professor mcgonagall snapped ron 
¡°miss patil, take ridiculous thing hair

¡°follow me, please,¡± said professor mcgonagall 
¡°first years front 


pushing 


¡± filed steps lined front castle 
cold, clear evening; dusk falling pale, transparent-looking moon already shining forbidden forest 
harry, standing ron hermione fourth row front, saw dennis creevey positively shivering anticipation among first years 
¡°nearly six,¡± said ron, checking watch staring drive led front gates 
¡°how d¡¯you reckon they¡¯re coming? train?¡± ¡°i doubt it,¡± said hennione 
¡°how, then? broomsticks?¡± harry suggested, looking starry sky 
¡°i don¡¯t think 


far away 


¡± ¡°a portkey?¡± ron suggested 
¡°or could apparate - maybe you¡¯re allowed seventeen wherever come from?¡± ¡°you can¡¯t apparate inside hogwarts grounds, often tell you?¡± said hermione impatiently 
scanned darkening grounds excitedly, nothing moving; everything still, silent, quite usual 
harry starting feel cold 
wished they¡¯d hurry 


maybe foreign students preparing dramatic entrance 


remembered mr 
weasley said back campsite quidditch world cup: ¡°always - can¡¯t resist showing get together 


¡± dumbledore called back row stood teachers - ¡°aha! unless much mistaken, delegation beauxbatons approaches!¡± ¡°where?¡± said many students eagerly, looking different directions 
¡°there!¡± yelled sixth year, pointing forest 
something large, much larger broomstick - or, indeed, hundred broomsticks - hurtling across deep blue sky toward castle, growing larger time 
¡°it¡¯s dragon!¡± shrieked one first years, losing head completely 
¡°don¡¯t stupid 


it¡¯s flying house!¡± said dennis creevey 
dennis¡¯s guess closer 


gigantic black shape skimmed treetops forbidden forest lights shining castle windows hit it, saw gigantic, powderblue, horse-drawn carriage, size large house, soaring toward them, pulled air dozen winged horses, palominos, size elephant 
front three rows students drew backward carriage hurtled ever lower, coming land tremendous speed - then, almighty crash made neville jump backward onto slytherin fifth year¡¯s foot, horses¡¯ hooves, larger dinner plates, hit ground 
second later, carriage landed too, bouncing upon vast wheels, golden horses tossed enonnous heads rolled large, fiery red eyes 
harry time see door carriage bore coat arms (two crossed, golden wands, emitting three stars) opened 
boy pale blue robes jumped carriage, bent forward, fumbled moment something carriage floor, unfolded set golden steps 
sprang back respectfully 
harry saw shining, high- heeled black shoe emerging inside carriage - shoe size child¡¯s sled - followed, almost immediately, largest woman ever seen life 
size carriage, horses, immediately explained 
people gasped 
harry ever seen one person large woman life, hagrid; doubted whether inch difference heights 
yet somehow - maybe simply used hagrid - woman (now foot steps, looking around waiting, wide-eyed crowd) seemed even unnaturally large 
stepped light flooding entrance hall, revealed handsome, olive-skinned face; large, black, liquid-looking eyes; rather beaky nose 
hair drawn back shining knob base neck 
dressed head foot black satin, many magnificent opals gleamed throat thick fingers 
dumbledore started clap; students, following lead, broke applause too, many standing tiptoe, better look woman 
face relaxed gracious smile walked forward toward dumbledore, extending glittering hand 
dumbledore, though tall himself, barely bend kiss 
¡°my dear madame maxime,¡± said 
¡°welcome hogwarts 
¡± ¡°dumbly-dort,¡± said madame maxime deep voice 
¡°i ¡®ope find well?¡± ¡°in excellent form, thank you,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°my pupils,¡± said madame maxime, waving one enormous hands carelessly behind 
harry, whose attention focused completely upon madame maxime, noticed dozen boys girls, all, look them, late teens, emerged carriage standing behind madame maxime 
shivering, unsurprising, given robes seemed made fine silk, none wearing cloaks 
wrapped scarves shawls around heads 
harry could see (they standing madame maxime¡¯s enormous shadow), staring hogwarts apprehensive looks faces 
¡°¡¯as karkaroff arrived yet?¡± madame maxime asked 
¡°he moment,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°would like wait greet would prefer step inside warm trifle?¡± ¡°warm up, think,¡± said madame maxime 
¡°but ze ¡®orses ¡°our care magical creatures teacher delighted take care them,¡± said dumbledore, ¡°the moment returned dealing slight situation arisen - er - charges

¡°my steeds require - er - forceful ¡®andling,¡± said madame maxime, looking though doubted whether care magical creatures teacher hogwarts could job 
¡°zey strong

¡°very well,¡± said madame maxime, bowing slightly 
¡°will please inform zis ¡®agrid zat ze ¡®orses drink single-malt whiskey?¡± ¡°it attended to,¡± said dumbledore, also bowing 
¡°come,¡± said madame maxime imperiously students, hogwarts crowd parted allow students pass stone steps 
¡°how big d¡¯you reckon durmstrang¡¯s horses going be?¡± seamus finnigan said, leaning around lavender parvati address harry ron 
¡°well, they¡¯re bigger lot, even hagrid won¡¯t able handle them,¡± said harry 
¡°that¡¯s hasn¡¯t attacked skrewts 
wonder what¡¯s them?¡± ¡°maybe they¡¯ve escaped,¡± said ron hopefully 
¡°oh don¡¯t say that,¡± said hermione shudder 
¡°imagine lot loose grounds 


¡± stood, shivering slightly now, waiting durmstrang party arrive 
people gazing hopefully sky 
minutes, silence broken madame maxime¡¯s huge horses snorting stamping 
- ¡°can hear something?¡± said ron suddenly 
harry listened; loud oddly eerie noise drifting toward darkness: muffled rumbling sucking sound, though immense vacuum cleaner moving along riverbed 
¡°the lake!¡± yelled lee jordan, pointing 
¡°look lake!¡± position top lawns overlooking grounds, clear view smooth black surface water - except surface suddenly smooth 
disturbance taking place deep center; great bubbles fonning surface, waves washing muddy banks - then, middle lake, whirlpool appeared, giant plug pulled lake¡¯s floor 


seemed long, black pole began rise slowly heart whirlpool 


harry saw rigging

black eyes alight malice 
¡°don¡¯t go blaming dumbledore potter¡¯s determination break rules 
crossing lines ever since arrived ¡°thank you, severus,¡± said dumbledore firmly, snape went quiet, though eyes still glinted malevolently curtain greasy black hair 
professor dumbledore looking harry, looked right back him, trying discern expression eyes behind half-moon spectacles 
¡°did put name goblet fire, harry?¡± asked calmly 
¡°no,¡± said harry

snape made soft noise impatient disbelief shadows 
¡°did ask older student put goblet fire you?¡± said professor dumbledore, ignoring snape 
¡°no,¡± said harry vehemently

¡°we must follow rules, rules state clearly people whose names come goblet fire bound compete tournament 
¡± ¡°well, barty knows rule book back front,¡± said bagman, beaming turning back karkaroff madame maxime, though matter closed 
¡°i insist upon resubmitting names rest students,¡± said karkaroff

¡°you set goblet fire more, continue adding names school two champions 
it¡¯s fair, dumbledore

¡°i¡¯m afraid don¡¯t understand you, moody 
¡± harry could tell trying sound disdainful, though moody saying barely worth notice, hands gave away; balled fists 
¡°don¡¯t you?¡± said moody quietly 
¡°it¡¯s simple, karkaroff 
someone put potter¡¯s name goblet knowing he¡¯d compete came 
¡± ¡°evidently, someone ¡®oo wished give ¡®ogwarts two bites ze apple!¡± said madame maxime

¡± ¡°there who¡¯ll turn innocent occasions advantage,¡± moody retorted menacing voice 
¡°it¡¯s job think way dark wizards do, karkaroff - ought remember 


¡± ¡°alastor!¡± said dumbledore warningly 
harry wondered moment speaking to, realized ¡°mad-eye¡± could hardly moody¡¯s real first name 
moody fell silent, though still surveying karkaroff satisfaction - karkaroff face burning 
¡°how situation arose, know,¡± said dumbledore, speaking everyone gathered room 
¡°it seems me, however, choice accept 
cedric harry chosen compete tournament 
this, therefore, 


¡°ah, dumbly-dorr ¡°my dear madame maxime, alternative, would delighted hear 
¡± dumbledore waited, madame maxime speak, merely glared

snape looked furious; karkaroff livid; bagman, however, looked rather excited 
¡°well, shall crack on, then?¡± said, rubbing hands together smiling around room 
¡°got give champions instructions, haven¡¯t we? barty, want honors?¡± mr

¡°professor karkaroff - madame maxime - nightcap?¡± said dumbledore 
madame maxime already put arm around fleur¡¯s shoulders leading swiftly room 
harry could hear talking fast french went great hall 
karkaroff beckoned krum, they, too, exited, though silence 
¡°harry, cedric, suggest go bed,¡± said dumbledore, smiling 
¡°i sure gryffindor hufflepuff waiting celebrate you, would shame deprive excellent excuse make great deal mess noise 
¡± harry glanced cedric, nodded, left together 
great hall deserted now; candles burned low, giving jagged smiles pumpkins eerie, flickering quality 
¡°so,¡± said cedric, slight smile 
¡°we¡¯re playing again!¡± ¡°i s¡¯pose,¡± said harry 
really couldn¡¯t think anything say 
inside head seemed complete disarray, though brain ransacked 
¡°so

¡± said cedric reached entrance hall, lit torches absence goblet fire 
¡°how get name in?¡± ¡°i didn¡¯t,¡± said harry, staring 
¡°i didn¡¯t put 
telling truth 
¡± ¡°ah 


okay,¡± said cedric 
harry could tell cedric didn¡¯t believe 
¡°well 


see you, 
¡± instead going marble staircase, cedric headed door right 
harry stood listening going stone steps beyond it, then, slowly, started climb marble ones 
anyone except ron hermione going believe him, would think he¡¯d put tournament? yet could anyone think that, facing competitors who¡¯d three years¡¯ magical education - facing tasks sounded dangerous, perfonned front hundreds people? yes, he¡¯d thought 


he¡¯d fantasized 


joke, really, idle sort dream 


he¡¯d never really, seriously considered entering 

someone else considered 


someone else wanted tournament, made sure entered 
why? give treat? didn¡¯t think so, somehow 


see make fool himself? well, likely get wish 


get killed? moody usual paranoid self? couldn¡¯t someone put harry¡¯s name goblet trick, practical joke? anyone really want dead? harry able answer 
yes, someone wanted dead, someone wanted dead ever since year old 


lord voldemort 
could voldemort ensured harry¡¯s name got goblet fire? voldemort supposed far away, distant country, hiding, alone 


feeble powerless 


yet dream had, awoken scar hurting, voldemort alone

¡°no, no, vi, it¡¯s password,¡± said fat lady soothingly, swung forward hinges let harry common room 
blast noise met harry¡¯s ears portrait opened almost knocked backward 
next thing knew, wrenched inside common room dozen pairs hands, facing whole gryffindor house, screaming, applauding, whistling 
¡°you should¡¯ve told us you¡¯d entered!¡± bellowed fred; looked half annoyed, half deeply impressed 
¡°how without getting beard? brilliant!¡± roared george 
¡°i didn¡¯t,¡± harry said 
¡°i don¡¯t know angelina swooped upon him; ¡°oh couldn¡¯t me, least it¡¯s gryffindor ¡°you¡¯ll able pay back diggory last quidditch match, harry!¡± shrieked katie bell, another gryffindor chasers 
¡°we¡¯ve got food, harry, come ¡°i¡¯m hungry, enough feast nobody wanted hear wasn¡¯t hungry; nobody wanted hear hadn¡¯t put name goblet; one single person seemed noticed wasn¡¯t mood celebrate 


lee jordan unearthed gryffindor banner somewhere, insisted draping around harry like cloak 
harry couldn¡¯t get away; whenever tried sidle staircase dormitories, crowd around closed ranks, forcing another butterbeer him, stuffing crisps peanuts hands 


everyone wanted know done it, tricked dumbledore¡¯s age line managed get name goblet 


¡°i didn¡¯t,¡± said, again, ¡°i don¡¯t know happened

¡°no, seriously, george - i¡¯m going bed wanted anything find ron hennione, find bit sanity, neither seemed common room 
insisting needed sleep, almost flattening little creevey brothers attempted waylay foot stairs, harry managed shake everyone climb dormitory fast could 
great relief, found ron lying bed otherwise empty dormitory, still fully dressed 
looked harry slammed door behind 
¡°where¡¯ve been?¡± harry said 
¡°oh hello,¡± said ron 
grinning, odd, strained sort grin 
harry suddenly became aware still wearing scarlet gryffindor banner lee tied around 
hastened take off, knotted tightly 
ron lay bed without moving, watching harry struggle remove 
¡°so,¡± said, harry finally removed banner thrown corner 
¡°congratulations 
¡± ¡°what d¡¯you mean, congratulations?¡± said harry, staring ron 
definitely something wrong way ron smiling: like grimace 
¡°well

¡°not even fred george

¡°oh right,¡± said ron

someone else must¡¯ve done 
¡± ron raised eyebrows 
¡°what would for?¡± ¡°i dunno,¡± said harry 
felt would sound melodramatic say, ¡°to kill 
¡± ron¡¯s eyebrows rose high danger disappearing hair 
¡°it¡¯s okay, know, tell truth,¡± said 
¡°if don¡¯t want everyone else know, fine, don¡¯t know you¡¯re bothering lie, didn¡¯t get trouble it, you? friend fat lady¡¯s, violet, she¡¯s already told us dumbledore¡¯s letting enter

¡°yeah?¡± said ron, trace grin, forced otherwise, face 
¡°you want get bed, harry 
expect you¡¯ll need early tomorrow photo-call something 
¡± wrenched hangings shut around four-poster, leaving harry standing door, staring dark red velvet curtains, hiding one people sure would believe 
chapter eighteen weighing wands harry woke sunday morning, took moment remember felt miserable worried 
memory previous night rolled 
sat ripped back curtains four-poster, intending talk ron, force ron believe - find ron¡¯s bed empty; obviously gone breakfast 
harry dressed went spiral staircase common room 
moment appeared, people already finished breakfast broke applause 
prospect going great hall facing rest gryffindors, treating like sort hero, inviting; that, however, stay allow cornered creevey brothers, beckoning frantically join 
walked resolutely portrait hole, pushed open, climbed it, found face-to-face hennione 
¡°hello,¡± said, holding stack toast, carrying napkin 
¡°i brought 


want go walk?¡± ¡°good idea,¡± said harry gratefully 
went downstairs, crossed entrance hall quickly without looking great hall, soon striding across lawn toward lake, durmstrang ship moored, reflected blackly water 
chilly morning, kept moving, munching toast, harry told hennione exactly happened left gryffindor table night 
immense relief, hennione accepted story without question 
¡°well, course knew hadn¡¯t entered yourself,¡± said he¡¯d finished telling scene chamber hall 
¡°the look face dumbledore read name! question is, put in? moody¡¯s right, harry

hennione hesitated 
¡°erm

¡°what¡¯s supposed mean, ¡®not really¡¯?¡± ¡°oh harry, isn¡¯t obvious?¡± hennione said despairingly 
¡°he¡¯s jealous!¡± ¡°jealous?¡± harry said incredulously 
¡°jealous what? wants make prat front whole school, he?¡± ¡°look,¡± said hennione patiently, ¡°it¡¯s always gets attention, know 
know it¡¯s fault,¡± added quickly, seeing harry open mouth furiously 
¡°i know don¡¯t ask 


- well - know, ron¡¯s got brothers compete home, you¡¯re best friend, you¡¯re really famous - he¡¯s always shunted one side whenever people see you, puts it, never mentions it, suppose one time many 


¡°great,¡± said harry bitterly 
¡°really great

tell he¡¯s welcome 


people gawping forehead everywhere go 


¡± ¡°i¡¯m teiling anything,¡± hennione said shortly 
¡°tell

¡± ¡°i¡¯m running around trying make grow up!¡± harry said, loudly several owls nearby tree took flight alann 
¡°maybe he¡¯ll believe i¡¯m enjoying i¡¯ve got neck broken ¡°that¡¯s funny,¡± said hennione quietly 
¡°that¡¯s funny 
¡± looked extremely anxious 
¡°harry, i¡¯ve thinking - know we¡¯ve got do, don¡¯t you? straight away, moment get back castle?¡± ¡°yeah, give ron good kick ¡°write sirius

asked keep posted everything that¡¯s going hogwarts 


it¡¯s almost expected something like happen

¡°he came back country scar twinged 
he¡¯ll probably come bursting right castle tell someone¡¯s entered triwizard tournament ¡°he¡¯d want tell him,¡± said hennione sternly 
¡°he¡¯s going find anyway 
¡± ¡°how?¡± ¡°harry, isn¡¯t going kept quiet,¡± said hennione, seriously 
¡°this tournament¡¯s famous, you¡¯re famous 
i¡¯ll really surprised isn¡¯t anything daily prophet competing 


you¡¯re already half books you-know-who, know 


sirius would rather hear you, know would 
¡± ¡°okay, okay, i¡¯ll write him,¡± said harry, throwing last piece toast lake 
stood watched floating moment, large tentacle rose water scooped beneath surface 
returned castle 
¡°whose owl going use?¡± harry said climbed stairs 
¡°he told use hedwig 
¡± ¡°ask ron borrow ¡°i¡¯m asking ron anything,¡± harry said flatly 
¡°well, borrow one school owls, then, anyone use them,¡± said hermione 
went owlery 
hermione gave harry piece parchment, quill, bottle ink, strolled around long lines perches, looking different owls, harry sat wall wrote letter 
dear sirius, told keep posted what's happening hogwarts, goes - 1 know heard, triwizard tournament' happening year saturday night got picked fourth champion 
put name goblet fire, 
hogwarts champion cedric diggory, hufflepuff paused point, thinking 
urge say something large weight anxiety seemed settled inside chest since last night, couldn¡¯t think translate words, simply dipped quill back ink bottle wrote, hope okay, buckbeak - harry ¡°finished,¡± told hennione, getting feet brushing straw robes 
this, hedwig fluttered onto shoulder held leg 
¡°i can¡¯t use you,¡± harry told her, looking around school owls 
¡°i¡¯ve got use one 
¡± hedwig gave loud hoot took suddenly talons cut shoulder 
kept back harry time tying letter leg large bam owl 
bam owl flown off, harry reached stroke hedwig, clicked beak furiously soared rafters reach 
¡°first ron, you,¡± harry said angrily 
¡°this isn¡¯t fault 
¡± harry thought matters would improve everyone got used idea champion, following day showed mistaken 
could longer avoid rest school back lessons - clear rest school, like gryffindors, thought harry entered tournament 
unlike gryffmdors, however, seem impressed 
hufflepuffs, usually excellent terms gryffmdors, turned remarkably cold toward whole lot 
one herbology lesson enough demonstrate 
plain hufflepuffs felt harry stolen champion¡¯s glory; feeling exacerbated, perhaps, fact hufflepuff house rarely got glory, cedric one ever given any, beaten gryffindor quidditch 
ernie macmillan justin finch fletchley, harry normally got well, talk even though repotting bouncing bulbs tray - though laugh rather unpleasantly one bouncing bulbs wriggled free harry¡¯s grip smacked hard face 
ron wasn¡¯t talking harry either 
hennione sat them, making forced conversation, though answered normally, avoided making eye contact 
harry thought even professor sprout seemed distant - then, head hufflepuff house 
would looking forward seeing hagrid normal circumstances, care magical creatures meant seeing slytherins - first time would come face-to-face since becoming champion 
predictably, malfoy arrived hagrid¡¯ cabin familiar sneer firmly place 
¡°ah, look, boys, it¡¯s champion,¡± said crabbe goyle moment got within earshot harry 
¡°got autograph books? better get signature now, doubt he¡¯s going around much longer 


half triwizard champions died 


long d¡¯you reckon you¡¯re going last, potter? ten minutes first task¡¯s bet 
¡± crabbe goyle guffawed sycophantically, malfoy stop there, hagrid emerged back cabin balancing teetering tower crates, containing large blast-ended skrewt 
class¡¯s horror, hagrid proceeded explain reason skrewts killing one another excess pent-up energy, solution would student fix leash skrewt take short walk 
good thing plan distracted malfoy completely 
¡°take thing walk?¡± repeated disgust, staring one boxes 
¡°and exactly supposed fix leash? around sting, blasting end, sucker?¡± ¡°roun¡¯ middle,¡± said hagrid, demonstrating 
¡°er - yeh might want ter put yer dragon-hide gloves, jus¡¯ extra precaution, like 
harry - come an¡¯ help big one 


hagrid¡¯s real intention, however, talk harry away rest class 
waited everyone else set skrewts, turned harry said, seriously, ¡°so - yer competin¡¯, harry 
tournament 
school champion 
¡± ¡°one champions,¡± harry corrected 
hagrid¡¯s beetle-black eyes looked anxious wild eyebrows 
¡°no idea put yeh fer it, harry?¡± ¡°you believe didn¡¯t it, then?¡± said harry, concealing difficulty rush gratitude felt hagrid¡¯s words 
¡°course do,¡± hagrid grunted 
¡°yeh say wasn¡¯ you, an¡¯ believe yeh - an¡¯ dumbledore believes yer, an¡¯ 
¡± ¡°wish knew it,¡± said harry bitterly 
pair looked lawn; class widely scattered now, great difficulty 
skrewts three feet long, extremely powerful 
longer shell- less colorless, developed kind thick, grayish, shiny annor 
looked like cross giant scorpions elongated crabs - still without recognizable heads eyes 
become immensely strong hard control 
¡°look like they¡¯re havin¡¯ fun, don¡¯ they?¡± hagrid said happily 
harry assumed talking skrewts, classmates certainly weren¡¯t; every then, alanning bang, one skrewts¡¯ ends would explode, causing shoot forward several yards, one person dragged along stomach, trying desperately get back feet 
¡°ah, don¡¯ know, harry,¡± hagrid sighed suddenly, looking back worried expression face 
¡°school champion 


everythin¡¯ seems ter happen ter you, doesn¡¯ it?¡± harry didn¡¯t answer 
yes, everything seem happen 


less hermione said walked around lake, reason, according her, ron longer talking 
next days harry¡¯s worst hogwarts 
closest ever come feeling like months, second year, large part school suspected attacking fellow students 
ron side 
thought could coped rest school¡¯s behavior could ron back friend, wasn¡¯t going try persuade ron talk ron didn¡¯t want 
nevertheless, lonely dislike pouring sides 
could understand hufflepuffs¡¯ attitude, even didn¡¯t like it; champion support 
expected nothing less vicious insults slytherins - highly unpopular always been, helped gryffindor beat often, quidditch inter-house championship 
hoped ravenclaws might found hearts support much cedric 
wrong, however 
ravenclaws seemed think desperate earn bit fame tricking goblet accepting name 
fact cedric looked part champion much 
exceptionally handsome, straight nose, dark hair, gray eyes, hard say receiving admiration days, cedric viktor krum 
harry actually saw sixth-year girls keen get krum¡¯s autograph begging cedric sign school bags one lunchtime 
meanwhile reply sirius, hedwig refusing come anywhere near him, professor trelawney predicting death even certainty usual, badly summoning charms professor flitwick¡¯s class given extra homework - person get any, apart neville 
¡°it¡¯s really difficult, harry,¡± hennione tried reassure left flitwick¡¯s class - making objects zoom across room lesson, though sort weird magnet board dusters, wastepaper baskets, lunascopes 
¡°you weren¡¯t concentrating properly -¡± ¡°wonder was,¡± said harry darkly cedric diggory walked past, surrounded large group simpering girls, looked harry though particularly large blast-ended skrewt 
¡°still - never mind, eh? double potions look forward afternoon 


¡± double potions always horrible experience, days nothing short torture 
shut dungeon hour half snape slytherins, seemed determined punish harry much possible daring become school champion, unpleasant thing harry could imagine 
already struggled one friday¡¯s worth, hennione sitting next intoning ¡°ignore them, ignore them, ignore them¡± breath, couldn¡¯t see today better 
hennione anived snape¡¯s dungeon lunch, found slytherins waiting outside, every one wearing large badge front robes 
one wild moment harry thought 
p 
e 
w 
badges - saw bore message, luminous red letters burnt brightly dimly lit underground passage: support cedric diggory¡ª real hogwarts champion! ¡°like them, potter?¡± said malfoy loudly hany approached 
¡°and isn¡¯t - look!¡± pressed badge chest, message upon vanished, replaced another one, glowed green: potter stinks! slytherins howled laughter 
pressed badges too, message potter stinks shining brightly around harry 
felt heat rise face neck 
¡°oh funny,¡± hermione said sarcastically pansy parkinson gang slytherin girls, laughing harder anyone, ¡°really witty 
¡± ron standing wall dean seamus 
wasn¡¯t laughing, wasn¡¯t sticking harry either 
¡°want one, granger?¡± said malfoy, holding badge hennione 
¡°i¡¯ve got loads 
don¡¯t touch hand, 
i¡¯ve washed it, see; don¡¯t want mudblood sliming 
¡± anger harry feeling days days seemed burst dam chest 
reached wand he¡¯d thought 
people around scrambled way, backing corridor 
¡°harry!¡± hermione said wamingly 
¡°go on, then, potter,¡± malfoy said quietly, drawing wand 
¡°moody¡¯s look - it, you¡¯ve got guts split second, looked other¡¯s eyes, then, exactly time, acted 
¡°funnunculus!¡± harry yelled 
¡°densaugeo!¡± screamed malfoy 
jets light shot wands, hit midair, ricocheted angles ¡ª harry¡¯s hit goyle face, malfoy¡¯s hit hermione 
goyle bellowed put hands nose, great ugly boils springing - hennione, whimpering panic, clutching mouth 
¡°hermione!¡± ron hurried forward see wrong her; harry turned saw ron dragging hermione¡¯s hand away face 
wasn¡¯t pretty sight 
hermione¡¯s front teeth - already larger average - growing alarming rate; looking like beaver teeth elongated, past bottom lip, toward chin - panic-stricken, felt let terrified cry

rita skeeter could say word, door broom cupboard pulled open 
harry looked around, blinking bright light 
albus dumbledore stood there, looking them, squashed cupboard 
¡°dumbledore!¡± cried rita skeeter, every appearance delight - harry noticed quill parchment suddenly vanished box magical mess remover, rita¡¯s clawed fingers hastily snapping shut clasp crocodile-skin bag

however, really hoped mr 
ollivander wasn¡¯t tell room 
funny feeling rita skeeter¡¯s quick- quotes quill might explode excitement 
mr 
ollivander spent much longer examining harry¡¯s wand anyone else¡¯s 
eventually, however, made fountain wine shoot it, handed back harry, announcing still perfect condition 
¡°thank all,¡± said dumbledore, standing judges¡¯ table 
¡°you may go back lessons - perhaps would quicker go dinner, end-¡± feeling last something gone right today, harry got leave, man black camera jumped cleared throat 
¡°photos, dumbledore, photos!¡± cried bagman excitedly 
¡°all judges champions, think, rita?¡± ¡°er - yes, let¡¯s first,¡± said rita skeeter, whose eyes upon harry 
¡°and perhaps individual shots 
¡± photographs took long time 
madame maxime cast everyone else shadow wherever stood, photographer couldn¡¯t stand far enough back get frame; eventually sit everyone else stood around 
karkaroff kept twirling goatee around finger give extra curl; krum, harry would thought would used sort thing, skulked, half-hidden, back group 
photographer seemed keenest get fleur front, rita skeeter kept hurrying forward dragging harry greater prominence 
insisted separate shots champions 
last, free go 
harry went dinner 
hermione wasn¡¯t - supposed still hospital wing teeth fixed 
ate alone end table, returned gryffindor tower, thinking extra work summoning channs 
donnitory, came across ron 
¡°you¡¯ve owl,¡± said ron brusquely moment walked 
pointing harry¡¯s pillow 
school barn owl waiting 
¡°oh - right,¡± said harry 
¡°and we¡¯ve got detentions tomorrow night, snape¡¯s dungeon,¡± said ron 
walked straight room, looking harry 
moment, harry considered going - wasn¡¯t sure whether wanted talk hit him, seemed quite appealing - lure sirius¡¯s answer strong 
harry strode barn owl, took letter leg, unrolled 
harry - can't say everything would like letter, risky case owl intercepted - need talk face-to-face 
ensure alone fire gryffindor tower one o'clock morning 22nd ofnovember? know better anyone look you' around durnbledore moody think anyone able hurt 
however, someone seems good try 
entering tournament would risky, especially right dumbkdore's nose 
watch, harry 
still want hear anything unusual 
let know 22nd ofnovember quickly 
sirius chapter nineteen hungarian horntail prospect talking face-to-face sirius sustained harry next fortnight, bright spot horizon never looked darker 
shock finding school champion worn slightly now, fear facing started sink 
first task drawing steadily nearer; felt though crouching ahead like horrific monster, barring path 
never suffered nerves like these; way beyond anything experienced quidditch match, even last one slytherin, decided would win quidditch cup 
harry finding hard think future all; felt though whole life heading to, would finish with, first task 
admittedly, didn¡¯t see sirius going make feel better perform unknown piece difficult dangerous magic front hundreds people, mere sight friendly face would something moment 
harry wrote back sirius saying would beside common room fire time sirius suggested; hennione spent long time going plans forcing stragglers common room night question 
worst came worst, going drop bag dungbombs, hoped wouldn¡¯t resort - filch would skin alive 
meantime, life became even worse harry within confines castle, rita skeeter published piece triwizard tournament, turned much report tournament highly colored life story harry 
much front page given picture harry; article (continuing pages two, six, seven) harry, names beauxbatons durmstrang champions (misspelled) squashed last line article, cedric hadn¡¯t mentioned 
article appeared ten days ago, harry still got sick, burning feeling shame stomach every time thought 
rita skeeter reported saying awful lot things couldn¡¯t remember ever saying life, let alone broom cupboard 
suppose get strength parents 
know they'd proud could see 


yes, sometimes night still cry them, fm ashamed admit 


know nothing hurt tournament, they're watching 


rita skeeter gone even transforming ¡°er¡¯s¡± long, sickly sentences: interviewed people 
harry last found love hogwarts 
close friend, colin creevey, says harry rarely seen company one hermione granger, stunningly pretty muggle-born girl who, like harry, one top studen ts school 
moment article appeared, harry endure people ¡ª slytherins, mainly ¡ª quoting passed making sneering comments 
¡°want hanky, potter, case start crying transfiguration?¡± ¡°since one top students school, potter? school longbottom set together?¡± ¡°hey - harry!¡± ¡°yeah, that¡¯s right!¡± harry found shouting wheeled around corridor, enough 
¡°i¡¯ve crying eyes dead mum, i¡¯m bit 


¡± ¡°no - - dropped quill 
¡± cho 
harry felt color rising face 
¡°oh - right - sorry,¡± muttered, taking quill back 
¡°er 


good luck tuesday,¡± said 
¡°i really hope well 
¡± left harry feeling extremely stupid 
hermione come fair share unpleasantness too, hadn¡¯t yet started yelling innocent bystanders; fact, harry full admiration way handling situation 
¡°stunningly pretty? her?¡± pansy parkinson shrieked first time come face-to-face hermione rita¡¯s article appeared 
¡°what judging - chipmunk?¡± ¡°ignore it,¡± hermione said dignified voice, holding head air stalking past sniggering slytherin girls though couldn¡¯t hear 
¡°just ignore it, harry 
¡± harry couldn¡¯t ignore 
ron hadn¡¯t spoken since told snape¡¯s detentions 
harry half hoped would make things two hours forced pickle rats¡¯ brains snape¡¯s dungeon, day rita¡¯s article appeared, seemed confirmed ron¡¯s belief harry really enjoying attention 
hennione furious pair them; went one other, trying force talk other, harry adamant: would talk ron ron admitted harry hadn¡¯t put name goblet fire apologized calling liar 
¡°i didn¡¯t start this,¡± harry said stubbornly 
¡°it¡¯s problem 
¡± ¡°you miss him!¡± hermione said impatiently 
¡°and know misses ¡°miss him?¡± said harry 
¡°i don¡¯t miss 


¡± downright lie 
harry liked hermione much, wasn¡¯t ron 
much less laughter lot hanging around library hermione best friend 
harry still hadn¡¯t mastered summoning channs, seemed developed something block them, hermione insisted learning theory would help 
consequently spent lot time poring books lunchtimes 
viktor krum library awful lot too, harry wondered 
studying, looking things help first task? hennione often complained krum - ever bothered - groups giggling girls often turned spy behind bookshelves, hermione found noise distracting 
¡°he¡¯s even good-looking!¡± muttered angrily, glaring krum¡¯s sharp profile 
¡°they like he¡¯s famous! wouldn¡¯t look twice couldn¡¯t wonkyfaint thing ¡°wronski feint,¡± said harry, gritted teeth 
quite apart liking get quidditch terms correct, caused another pang imagine ron¡¯s expression could heard hermione talking wonky-faints 
strange thing, dreading something, would give anything slow time, disobliging habit speeding 
days first task seemed slip though someone fixed clocks work double speed 
harry¡¯s feeling barely controlled panic wherever went, everpresent snide comments daily prophet article 
saturday first task, students third year permitted visit village hogsmeade 
hermione told harry would good get away castle bit, harry didn¡¯t need much persuasion 
¡°what ron, though?¡± said 
¡°don¡¯t want go him?¡± ¡°oh 


well 


¡± hennione went slightly pink 
¡°i thought might meet three broomsticks 


¡± ¡°no,¡± said harry flatly 
¡°oh harry, stupid ¡°i¡¯ll come, i¡¯m meeting ron, i¡¯m wearing invisibility cloak 
¡± ¡°oh right 

hermione snapped, ¡°but hate talking cloak, never know i¡¯m looking 
¡± harry put invisibility cloak dormitory, went back downstairs, together hennione set hogsmeade 
harry felt wonderfully free cloak; watched students walking past entered village, sporting support cedric diggory! badges, horrible remarks came way change, nobody quoting stupid article 
¡°people keep looking now,¡± said hermione grumpily came honeydukes sweetshop later, eating large cream-filled chocolates 
¡°they think i¡¯m talking 
¡± ¡°don¡¯t move lips much 
¡± ¡°come on, please take cloak bit, one¡¯s going bother 
¡± ¡°oh yeah?¡± said harry 
¡°look behind 
¡± rita skeeter photographer friend emerged three broomsticks pub 
talking low voices, passed right hermione without hooking 
harry backed wall honeydukes stop rita skeeter hitting crocodile-skin handbag 
gone, harry said, ¡°she¡¯s staying village 
bet she¡¯s coming watch first task 
¡± said it, stomach flooded wave molten panic 
didn¡¯t mention this; hermione hadn¡¯t discussed coming first task much; feeling didn¡¯t want think 
¡°she¡¯s gone,¡± said hermione, looking right harry toward end street 
¡°why don¡¯t go butterbeer three broomsticks, it¡¯s bit cold, isn¡¯t it? don¡¯t talk ron!¡± added irritably, correctly interpreting silence 
three broomsticks packed, mainly hogwarts students enjoying free afternoon, also variety magical people harry rarely saw anywhere else 
harry supposed hogsmeade all-wizard village britain, bit creatures like hags, adept wizards disguising 
hard move crowds invisibility cloak, case accidentally trod someone, tended lead awkward questions 
harry edged slowly toward spare table comer hermione went buy drinks 
way pub, harry spotted ron, sitting fred, george, lee jordan 
resisting urge give ron good hard poke back head, finally reached table sat 
hermione joined moment later slipped butterbeer cloak

¡°you know, i¡¯m starting think it¡¯s time direct action

hennione lapsed thoughtful silence, harry drank butterbeer, watching people pub

he¡¯d really hooking forward it, watching whatever 


cheering cedric everyone else, safe seat back stands 


wondered champions feeling 
every time seen cedric lately, surrounded admirers looking nervous excited 
harry glimpsed fleur delacour time time corridors; looked exactly always did, haughty unruffled 
krum sat library, poring books 
harry thought sirius, tight, tense knot chest seemed ease slightly 
would speaking twelve hours, tonight night meeting common room fire - assuming nothing went wrong, everything else done lately 


¡°look, it¡¯s hagrid!¡± said hermione 
back hagrid¡¯s enormous shaggy head - mercifully abandoned bunches - emerged crowd 
harry wondered hadn¡¯t spotted once, hagrid large, standing carefully, saw hagrid leaning low, talking professor moody 
hagrid usual enormous tankard front him, moody drinking hip flask 
madam rosmerta, pretty landlady, didn¡¯t seem think much this; looking askance moody collected glasses tables around 
perhaps thought insult mulled mead, harry knew better 
moody told last defense dark arts lesson preferred prepare food drink times, easy dark wizards poison unattended cup 
harry watched, saw hagrid moody get leave 
waved, remembered hagrid couldn¡¯t see 
moody, however, paused, magical eye comer harry standing 
tapped hagrid small back (being unable reach shoulder), muttered something him, pair made way back across pub toward harry hermione¡¯s table 
¡°all right, hermione?¡± said hagrid loudly

moody limped around table bent down; harry thought reading

moody followed 
¡°why hagrid want meet midnight?¡± harry said, surprised 
¡°does he?¡± said hennione, looking startled 
¡°i wonder he¡¯s to? don¡¯t know whether go, harry 


¡± looked nervously around hissed, ¡°it might make late sirius 
¡± true going hagrid¡¯s midnight would mean cutting meeting sirius fine indeed; hermione suggested sending hedwig hagrid¡¯s tell couldn¡¯t go - always assuming would consent take note, course - harry, however, thought better quick whatever hagrid wanted 
curious know might be; hagrid never asked harry visit late night 
half past eleven evening, harry, pretended go bed early, pulled invisibility cloak back crept back downstairs common room 
quite people still 
creevey brothers managed get hold stack support cedric diggory! badges trying bewitch make say support harry potter! instead 
far, however, managed get badges stuck potter stinks 
harry crept past portrait hole waited minute so, keeping eye watch

¡°you there, harry?¡± hagrid whispered, opening door looking around 
¡°yeah,¡± said harry, slipping inside cabin pulling cloak head 
¡°what¡¯s up?¡± ¡°got summat ter show yeh,¡± said hagrid

didn¡¯t get soon, going turn around, go straight back castle, leave hagrid enjoy moonlit stroll madame maxime 
- walked far around perimeter forest castle lake sight - harry heard something 
men shouting ahead 


came deafening, earsplitting roar 


hagrid led madame maxime around clump trees came halt 
harry hurried alongside - split second, thought seeing bonfires, men darting around - mouth fell open

¡°it¡¯s good!¡± yelled another wizard 
¡°stunning spells, count three!¡± harry saw dragon keepers pull wand 
¡°stupefy!¡± shouted unison, stunning spells shot darkness like fiery rockets, bursting showers stars dragons¡¯ scaly hides - harry watched dragon nearest teeter dangerously back legs; jaws stretched wide silent howl; nostrils suddenly devoid flame, though still smoking - then, slowly, fell

¡°how could let enter tournament, he¡¯s much young! thought safe, thought going age limit! floods daily prophet article 
¡®he still cries parents! oh bless him, never knew! ¡¯¡± harry enough 
trusting fact hagrid wouldn¡¯t miss him, attractions four dragons madame maxime occupy him, turned silently began walk away, back castle

karkaroff follow sound voices, he, like madame maxime, would know store champions 
looks it, champion would facing unknown tuesday cedric 
harry reached castle, slipped front doors, began climb marble stairs; breath, didn¡¯t dare slow 


less five minutes get fire 
¡°balderdash!¡± gasped fat lady, snoozing frame front portrait hole 
¡°if say so,¡± muttered sleepily, without opening eyes, picture swung forward admit 
harry climbed inside 
common room deserted, and, judging fact smelled quite normal, hermione needed set dungbombs ensure sirius got privacy 
harry pulled invisibility cloak threw annchair front fire 
room semidarkness; flames source light 
nearby, table, support cedric diggory! badges creeveys trying improve glinting firelight 
read potter really stinks 
harry looked back flames, jumped 
sirius¡¯s head sitting fire 
harry hadn¡¯t seen mr

¡°never mind me, you?¡± said sirius seriously 
¡°i¡¯m second, harry tried say ¡°fine¡± - couldn¡¯t 
could stop himself, talking he¡¯d talked days - one believed hadn¡¯t entered tournament free will, rita skeeter lied daily prophet, couldn¡¯t walk corridor without sneered - ron, ron believing him, ron¡¯s jealousy 


hagrid¡¯s shown what¡¯s coming first task, it¡¯s dragons, sirius, i¡¯m goner,¡± finished desperately 
sirius looked him, eyes full concern, eyes yet lost look azkaban given - deadened, haunted look let harry talk silence without interruption, said, ¡°dragons deal with, harry, we¡¯ll get minute - 1 haven¡¯t got long 


i¡¯ve broken wizarding house use fire, could back time

¡°- reading lines skeeter woman¡¯s article last month, moody attacked night started hogwarts 
yes, know says another false alarm,¡± sirius said hastily, seeing harry speak, ¡°but don¡¯t think so, somehow 
think someone tried stop getting hogwarts 
think someone knew job would lot difficult around 
one¡¯s going look closely; mad-eye¡¯s heard intruders bit often 
doesn¡¯t mean can¡¯t still spot real thing 
moody best auror ministry ever 
¡± ¡°so 


saying?¡± said harry slowly 
¡°karkaroff trying kill me? - why?¡± sirius hesitated 
¡°i¡¯ve hearing strange things,¡± said slowly 
¡°the death eaters seem bit active usual lately 
showed quidditch world cup, didn¡¯t they? someone set dark mark

¡°listen, knew bertha jorkins,¡± said sirius grimly 
¡°she hogwarts was, years dad

nosy, brains, none 
it¡¯s good combination, harry 
i¡¯d say she¡¯d easy lure trap 
¡± ¡°so 


voldemort could found tournament?¡± said harry 
¡°is mean? ou think karkaroff might orders?¡± ¡°i don¡¯t know,¡± said sirius slowly, ¡°i don¡¯t know 


karkaroff doesn¡¯t strike type who¡¯d go back voldemort unless knew voldemort powerful enough protect 
whoever put name goblet reason, can¡¯t help thinking tournament would good way attack make hook like accident 
¡± ¡°looks hike really good plan i¡¯m standing,¡± said harry grinning bleaky 
¡°they¡¯ll stand back let dragons stuff 
¡± ¡°right - dragons,¡± said sirius, speaking quickly 
¡°there¡¯s way, harry 
don¡¯t tempted try stunning spell - dragons strong powerfully magical knocked single stunner, need half dozen wizards time overcome dragon ¡°yeah, know, saw,¡± said harry 
¡°but alone,¡± said sirius 
¡°there away, simple spell¡¯s need 
harry held hand silence him, heart suddenly pounding though would burst 
could hear footsteps coming spiral staircase behind 
¡°go!¡± hissed sirius 
¡°go! there¡¯s someone coming!¡± harry scrambled feet, hiding fire - someone saw sirius¡¯s face within walls hogwarts, would raise almighty uproar - ministry would get dragged - he, harry, would questioned sirius¡¯s whereabouts - harry heard tiny pop! fire behind knew sirius gone 
watched bottom spiral staircase 
decided go stroll one o¡¯clock morning, stopped sirius telling get past dragon? ron 
dressed maroon paisley pajamas, ron stopped dead facing harry across room, looked around 
¡°who talking to?¡± said 
¡°what¡¯s got you?¡± harry snarled 
¡°what time night?¡± ¡°i wondered ron broke off, shrugging 
¡°nothing

knew ron idea he¡¯d walked on, knew hadn¡¯t done purpose, didn¡¯t care - moment hated everything ron, right several inches bare ankle showing beneath pajama trousers 
¡°sorry that,¡± said ron, face reddening anger 
¡°should¡¯ve realized didn¡¯t want disturbed 
i¡¯ll let get practicing next interview peace 
¡± harry seized one potter really stinks badges table chucked it, hard could, across room 
hit ron forehead bounced 
¡°there go,¡± harry said 
¡°something wear tuesday

that¡¯s want, isn¡¯t it?¡± strode across room toward stairs; half expected ron stop him, would even liked ron throw punch him, ron stood too-small pajamas, harry, stormed upstairs, lay awake bed fuming long time afterward didn¡¯t hear come bed

he¡¯d finally got clothes right parts body, hurried find hennione, locating gryffindor table great hall, eating breakfast ginny 
feeling queasy eat, harry waited hennione swallowed last spoonful porridge, dragged onto grounds 
there, told dragons, everything sirius said, took another long walk around lake 
alanned sirius¡¯s warnings karkaroff, hennione still thought dragons pressing problem 
¡°let¡¯s try keep alive tuesday evening,¡± said desperately, ¡°and wony karkaroff 
¡± walked three times around lake, trying way think simple spell would subdue dragon 
nothing whatsoever occurred them, retired library instead 
here, harry pulled every book could find dragons, set work searching large pile 
¡°talon-clipping channs 


treating scale-rot 


good, nutters like hagrid want keep healthy 


¡°dragons extremely difficult slay, owing ancient magic imbues thick hides, none powerful spells penetrate 


¡¯ sirius said simple one would 


¡°let¡¯s try simple spellbooks, then,¡± said harry, throwing aside men love dragons much 
returned table pile spellbooks, set down, began flick turn, hennione whispering nonstop elbow 
¡°well, switching spells 


what¡¯s point switching it? unless swapped fangs wine-gums something would make less dangerous 


trouble is, like book said, much going get dragon¡¯s hide 


i¡¯d say transfigure it, something big, really haven¡¯t got hope, doubt even professor mcgonagall 


unless you¡¯re supposed put spell yourself? maybe give extra powers? they¡¯re simple spells, mean, haven¡¯t done class, know i¡¯ve

¡°oh no, he¡¯s back again, can¡¯t read stupid ship?¡± said hermione irritably viktor krum slouched in, cast surly look pair them, settled distant comer pile books 
¡°come on, harry, we¡¯ll go back common room 


fan club¡¯ll moment, twittering away 


¡° sure enough, left library, gang girls tiptoed past them, one wearing bulgaria scarf tied around waist 
harry barely slept night 
awoke monday morning, seriously considered first time ever running away hogwarts 
looked around great hall breakfast time, thought leaving castle would mean, knew couldn¡¯t 
place ever happy 


well, supposed must happy parents too, couldn¡¯t remember 
somehow, knowledge would rather facing dragon back privet drive dudley good know; made feel slightly calmer 
finished bacon difficulty (his throat wasn¡¯t working well), hennione got up, saw cedric diggory leaving hufflepuff table 
cedric still didn¡¯t know dragons 


champion didn¡¯t, harry right thinking maxime karkaroff would told fleur krum 


¡°hermione, i¡¯ll see greenhouses,¡± harry said, coming decision watched cedric leaving hall 
¡°go

harry didn¡¯t want talk cedric front them; among quoting rita skeeter¡¯s article every time went near 
followed cedric distance saw heading toward charms corridor 
gave harry idea 
pausing distance them, pulled wand, took careful aim 
¡°diffindo!¡± cedric¡¯s bag split 
parchment, quills, books spilled onto floor

¡± cedric straightened up, arms full inky quills, parchment, books, ripped bag dangling one shoulder 
stared harry, puzzled, almost suspicious look eyes 
¡°why telling me?¡± asked 
harry looked disbelief 
sure cedric wouldn¡¯t asked seen dragons 
harry wouldn¡¯t let worst enemy face monsters unprepared - well, perhaps malfoy snape 


¡°it¡¯s 


fair, isn¡¯t it?¡± said cedric 
¡°we know

harry followed him, wondering going happen 
moody wanted know he¡¯d found dragons? would moody go dumbledore tell hagrid, turn harry ferret? well, might easier get past dragon ferret, harry thought dully, he¡¯d smaller, much less easy see height fifty feet 


followed moody office 
moody closed door behind turned look harry, magical eye fixed upon well nonnal one 
¡°that decent thing did, potter,¡± moody said quietly 
harry didn¡¯t know say; wasn¡¯t reaction expected

humming slightly 
appeared mirror hung opposite harry wall, reflecting room 
shadowy figures moving around inside it, none clearly focus 
¡°like dark detectors, you?¡± said moody, watching harry closely 
¡°what¡¯s that?¡± harry asked, pointing squiggly golden aerial 
¡°secrecy sensor

¡°so

he¡¯d afraid - hadn¡¯t told cedric, certainly wasn¡¯t going tell moody, hagrid broken rules 
¡°it¡¯s right,¡± said moody, sitting stretching wooden leg groan 
¡°cheating¡¯s traditional part triwizard tournament always

even threw egg across room - though hadn¡¯t really expected help

harry went back castle later afternoon ron hennione, unable banish image happy expression hagrid¡¯s whiskery face imagined harry winning tournament 
incomprehensible egg weighed heavily ever harrys conscience evening, time got bed, made mind - time shelve pride see cedric¡¯s hint worth anything 
chapter twenty-five egg eye harry idea long bath would need work secret golden egg, decided night, would able take much time wanted 
reluctant though accept favors cedric, also decided use prefects¡¯ bathroom; far fewer people allowed there, much less likely would disturbed 
harry planned excursion carefully, caught bed out-of-bounds filch caretaker middle night before, desire repeat experience 
invisibility cloak would, course, essential, added precaution, harry thought would take marauders map, which, next cloak, useful aid rule-breaking harry owned 
map showed whole hogwarts, including many shortcuts secret passageways and, important all, revealed people inside castle minuscule, labeled dots, moving around corridors, harry would forewarned somebody approaching bathroom 
thursday night, harry sneaked bed, put cloak, crept back downstairs, and, done night hagrid shown dragons, waited portrait hole open 
time ron waited outside give fat lady password (¡°banana fritters¡±), ¡°good luck,¡± ron muttered, climbing room harry crept past 
awkward moving cloak tonight, harry heavy egg one arm map held front nose 
however, moonlit corridors empty silent, checking map strategic intervals, harry able ensure wouldn¡¯t run anyone wanted avoid 
reached statue boris bewildered, lost-looking wizard gloves wrong hands, located right door, leaned close it, muttered password, ¡°pine fresh,¡± cedric told 
door creaked open 
harry slipped inside, bolted door behind him, pulled invisibility cloak, looking around 
immediate reaction would worth becoming prefect able use bathroom 
softly lit splendid candle-filled chandelier, everything made white marble, including looked like empty, rectangular swimming pool sunk middle floor 
hundred golden taps stood around pools edges, differently colored jewel set handle 
also diving board 
long white linen curtains hung windows; large pile fluffy white towels sat corner, single golden-framed painting wall 
featured blonde mermaid fast asleep rock, long hair face 
fluttered every time snored 
harry moved forward, looking around, footsteps echoing walls 
magnificent though bathroom - quite keen though try taps - couldn¡¯t quite suppress feeling cedric might 
earth supposed help solve mystery egg? nevertheless, put one huffy towels, cloak, map, egg side swimming-pool-sized bath, knelt turned taps 
could tell carried different sorts bubble bath mixed water, though wasn¡¯t bubble bath harry ever experienced 
one tap gushed pink blue bubbles size footballs; another poured ice-white foam thick harry thought would supported weight he¡¯d cared test it; third sent heavily perfumed purple clouds hovering surface water 
harry amused awhile turning taps off, particularly enjoying effect one whose jet bounced surface water large arcs 
then, deep pool full hot water, foam, bubbles, took short time considering size, harry turned taps, pulled pajamas, slippers, dressing gown, slid water 
deep feet barely touched bottom, actually couple lengths swimming back side treading water, staring egg 
highly enjoyable though swim hot foamy water clouds different-colored steam wafting around him, stroke brilliance came him, sudden burst understanding 
harry stretched arms, lifted egg wet hands, opened 
wailing, screeching sound filled bathroom, echoing reverberating marble walls, sounded incomprehensible ever, echoes 
snapped shut again, worried sound would attract filch, wondering whether hadn¡¯t cedric¡¯s plan - then, making jump badly dropped egg, clattered away across bathroom floor, someone spoke 
¡°i¡¯d try putting water, 
¡± harry swallowed considerable amount bubbles shock 
stood up, sputtering, saw ghost glum-looking girl sitting cross-legged top one taps

¡°myrtle!¡± harry said outrage, ¡°i¡¯m - i¡¯m wearing anything!¡± foam dense hardly mattered, nasty feeling myrtle spying one taps ever since arrived 
¡°i closed eyes got in,¡± said, blinking thick spectacles 
¡°you haven¡¯t see ages

gurgling song coming it, song whose words couldnt distinguish water 
¡°you need put head too,¡± said myrtle, seemed thoroughly enjoying bossing around 
¡°go on!¡± harry took great breath slid surface - now, sitting marble bottom bubble-filled bath, heard chorus eerie voices singing open egg hands: ¡° come seek us voices sound, cannot sing ground, searching, ponder this: we've taken sorely miss, hour long you' look, recover took, past hour- prospect's black, late, gone, come back" harry let float back upward broke bubbly surface, shaking hair eyes 
¡°hear it?¡± said myrtle

merpeople would surely live right bottom 


¡°myrtle,¡± harry said slowly, ¡°how supposed breathe?¡± this, myrtle¡¯s eyes filled sudden tears 
¡°tactless!¡± muttered, groping robes handkerchief 
¡°what¡¯s tactless?¡± said harry, bewildered 
¡°talking breathing front me!¡± said shrilly, voice echoed loudly around bathroom 
¡°when can¡¯t

buried face handkerchief sniffed loudly 
harry remembered touchy myrtle always dead, none ghosts knew made fuss 
¡°sorry,¡± said impatiently 
¡°i didn¡¯t mean - 1 forgot

¡°will come visit bathroom sometime?¡± moaning myrtle asked mournfully harry picked invisibility cloak

¡± ¡°bye, ¡®bye,¡± said gloomily, harry put invisibility cloak saw zoom back tap 
dark corridor, harry examined marauders map check coast still clear 
yes, dots belonging filch cat, mrs 
norris, safely office 


nothing else seemed moving apart peeves, though bouncing around trophy room floor 


harry taken first step back toward gryffindor tower something else map caught eye 


something distinctly odd 
peeves thing moving 
single dot flitting around room bottom left-hand corner - snapes office 
dot wasn¡¯t labeled ¡°severus snape¡± 


bartemius crouch 
harry stared dot 
mr 
crouch supposed ill go work come yule ball - doing, sneaking hogwarts one o¡¯clock morning? harry watched closely dot moved around around room, pausing 


harry hesitated, thinking 


curiosity got better 
turned set opposite direction toward nearest staircase 
going see crouch 
harry walked stairs quietly possible, though faces portraits still turned curiously squeak floorboard, rustle pajamas 
crept along corridor below, pushed aside tapestry halfway along, proceeded narrower staircase, shortcut would take two floors 
kept glancing map, wondering 


didn¡¯t seem character, somehow, correct, law-abiding mr 
crouch sneaking around somebody else¡¯s office late night 


then, halfway staircase, thinking doing, concentrating anything peculiar behavior mr 
crouch, harrys leg suddenly sank right trick step neville always forgot jump 
gave ungainly wobble, golden egg, still damp bath, slipped arm 
lurched forward try catch it, late; egg fell long staircase bang loud bass drum every step - invisibility cloak slipped - harry snatched it, marauder map fluttered hand slid six stairs, where, sunk step knee, couldn¡¯t reach 
golden egg fell tapestry bottom staircase, burst open, began wailing loudly corridor 
harry pulled wand struggled touch marauder map, wipe blank, far away reach - pulling cloak back harry straightened up, listening hard eyes screwed fear 


and, almost immediately - ¡°peeves!¡± unmistakable hunting cry filch caretaker 
harry could hear rapid, shuffling footsteps coming nearer nearer, wheezy voice raised fury 
¡°what¡¯s racket? wake whole castle, you? i¡¯ll you, peeves, i¡¯ll you, you¡¯ll 


this?¡± filch¡¯s footsteps halted; clink metal metal wailing stopped - filch picked egg closed 
harry stood still, one leg still jammed tightly magical step, listening 
moment now, filch going pull aside tapestry, expecting see peeves

came stairs, would spot marauder¡¯s map 


invisibility cloak not, map would show ¡°harry potter¡± standing exactly 
¡°egg?¡± filch said quietly foot stairs 
¡°my sweet!¡± - mrs 
norris obviously - ¡°this triwizard clue! belongs school champion!¡± harry felt sick; heart hammering fast - ¡°peeves!¡± filch roared gleefully 
¡°you¡¯ve stealing!¡± ripped back tapestry below, harry saw horrible, pouchy face bulging, pale eyes staring dark (to filch) deserted staircase 
¡°hiding, you?¡± said softly 
¡°i¡¯m coming get you, peeves

¡± filch started climb stairs, scrawny, dust-colored cat heels

occasion wonder whether invisibility cloak worked cats 


sick apprehension, watched filch drawing nearer nearer old flannel dressing gown - tried desperately pull trapped leg free, merely sank inches - second now, filch going spot map walk right - ¡°filch? whats going on?¡± filch stopped steps harry turned 
foot stairs stood person could make harry¡¯s situation worse: snape 
wearing long gray nightshirt looked livid 
¡°it¡¯s peeves, professor,¡± filch whispered malevolently 
¡°he threw egg stairs 
¡± snape climbed stairs quickly stopped beside filch 
harry gritted teeth, convinced loudly thumping heart would give away second 


¡°peeves?¡± said snape softly, staring egg filch¡¯s hands 
¡°but peeves couldn¡¯t get office 


¡± ¡°this egg office

¡°i seal office spell none wizard could break!¡± snape looked stairs, straight harry, corridor 
¡°i want come help search intruder, filch 
¡± ¡°i - yes, professor - filch looked yearningly stairs, right harry, could see reluctant forgo chance cornering peeves

¡°professor snape heard noises, professor,¡± said filch 
¡°peeves poltergeist, throwing things around usual - professor snape discovered someone broken ¡°shut up!¡± snape hissed filch 
moody took step closer foot stairs 
harry saw moodys magical eye travel snape, then, unmistakably, onto 
harrys heart gave horrible jolt 
moody could see invisibility cloaks 


alone could see full strangeness scene: snape nightshirt, filch clutching egg, he, harry, trapped stairs behind 
moody¡¯s lopsided gash mouth opened surprise 
seconds, harry stared straight other¡¯s eyes 
moody closed mouth turned blue eye upon snape 
¡°did hear correctly, snape?¡± asked slowly 
¡°someone broke office?¡± ¡°it unimportant,¡± said snape coldly 
¡°on contrary,¡± growled moody, ¡°it important 
who¡¯d want break office?¡± ¡°a student, daresay,¡± said snape 
harry could see vein flickering horribly snape¡¯s greasy temple

¡± ¡°reckon potion ingredients, eh?¡± said moody 
¡°not hiding anything else office, you?¡± harry saw edge snapes sallow face turn nasty brick color, vein temple pulsing rapidly

¡°i refuse believe gave orders search office!¡± ¡°course dumbledore trusts you,¡± growled moody 
¡°he¡¯s trusting man, isn¡¯t he? believes second chances 
- 1 say spots don¡¯t come off, snape 
spots never come off, d¡¯you know mean?¡± snape suddenly something strange 
seized left forearm convulsively right hand, though something hurt 
moody laughed 
¡°get back bed, snape 
¡± ¡°you don¡¯t authority send anywhere!¡± snape hissed, letting go arm though angry 
¡°i much right prowl school dark do!¡± ¡°prowl away,¡± said moody, voice full menace 
¡°i look forward meeting dark corridor time

¡°my mistake,¡± moody said calmly 
¡°it¡¯s mine - must¡¯ve dropped earlier snape¡¯s black eyes darting egg filch¡¯s arms map moodys hand, harry could tell putting two two together, snape could 


¡°potter,¡± said quietly 
¡°what¡¯s that?¡± said moody calmly, folding map pocketing 
¡°potter!¡± snape snarled, actually turned head stared right place harry was, though could suddenly see 
¡°that egg potters egg 
piece parchment belongs potter 
seen before, recognize it! potter here! potter, invisibility cloak!¡± snape stretched hands like blind man began move stairs; harry could sworn over-large nostrils dilating, trying sniff harry - trapped 
harry leaned backward, trying avoid snapes fingertips, moment now- ¡°there¡¯s nothing there, snape!¡± barked moody, ¡°but i¡¯ll happy tell headmaster quickly mind jumped harry potter!¡± ¡°meaning what?¡± snape turned look moody, hands still outstretched, inches harry¡¯s chest 
¡°meaning dumbledore¡¯s interested know who¡¯s got boy!¡± said moody, limping nearer still foot stairs 
¡°and i, snape

¡± torchlight flickered across mangled face, scars, chunk missing nose, looked deeper darker ever 
snape looking moody, harry couldn¡¯t see expression face 
moment, nobody moved said anything 
snape slowly lowered hands 
¡°i merely thought,¡± said snape, voice forced calm, ¡°that potter wandering around hours 


it¡¯s unfortunate habit 


stopped 
- safety 
¡± ¡°ah, see,¡± said moody softly 
¡°got potter¡¯s best interests heart, you?¡± pause

¡± snape swept downstairs passed moody without another word 
filch made chirruping noise mrs

harry heard snape walking away corridor; filch handed moody egg disappeared view too, muttering mrs

¡°i don¡¯t know,¡± harry muttered, ¡°odd stuffs happening lately, hasn¡¯t it? it¡¯s daily prophet 


dark mark world cup, death eaters everything 


¡± moody¡¯s mismatched eyes widened 
¡°you¡¯re sharp boy

¡°crouch could thinking along lines,¡± said slowly 
¡°very possible 


funny rumors flying around lately - helped along rita skeeter, course 
it¡¯s making lot people nervous, reckon 
¡± grim smile twisted lopsided mouth 
¡°oh there¡¯s one thing hate,¡± muttered, harry, magical eye fixed left-hand corner map, ¡°its death eater walked free 


¡± harry stared 
could moody possibly mean harry thought meant? ¡°and want ask question potter,¡± said moody businesslike tone 
harrys heart sank; thought coming

¡°yeah, okay 
¡± ¡°good boy,¡± growled moody

¡°you want consider it,¡± said moody, nodding looking harry thoughtfully 
¡°yes, indeed 


incidentally

¡°i¡¯ve working clue 
¡± moody winked him, magical eye going haywire 
¡°nothing like nighttime stroll give ideas, potter

¡± went back office, staring marauders map again, closed door behind 
harry walked slowly back gryffindor tower, lost thought snape, crouch, meant 


crouch pretending ill, could manage get hogwarts wanted to? think snape concealing office? moody thought 
harry, ought auror! interesting idea

harry thought, got quietly four-poster ten minutes later, egg cloak safely back trunk, thought he¡¯d like check scarred rest chose career 
chapter twenty-six second task ¡°you said you¡¯d already worked egg clue!¡± said hermione indignantly 
¡°keep voice down!¡± said harry crossly 
¡°i need - sort fine-tune it, right?¡± he, ron, hermione sitting back charms class table

¡°just forget egg minute, right?¡± harry hissed professor flitwick went whizzing resignedly past them, landing top large cabinet 
¡°i¡¯m trying tell snape moody

harry recounting adventures previous night whispered installments last half hour 
¡°snape said moodys searched office well?¡± ron whispered, eyes alight interest banished cushion sweep wand (it soared air kn ocked parvati¡¯s hat off) 
¡°what 


d¡¯you reckon moody¡¯s keep eye snape well karkaroff?¡± ¡°well, dunno that¡¯s dumbledore asked do, he¡¯s definitely it,¡± said harry, waving wand without paying much attention, cushion odd sort belly flop desk 
¡°moody said dumbledore lets snape stay he¡¯s giving second chance something 


¡± ¡°what?¡± said ron, eyes widening, next cushion spinning high air, ricocheting chandelier, dropping heavily onto flitwick¡¯s desk 
¡°harry 


maybe moody thinks snape put name goblet fire!¡± ¡°oh ron,¡± said hermione, shaking head sceptically, ¡°we thought snape trying kill harry before, turned saving harry¡¯s life, remember?¡± banished cushion flew across room landed box supposed aiming 
harry looked hermione, thinking 


true snape saved life once, odd thing was, snape definitely loathed him, he¡¯d loathed harry¡¯s father school together 
snape loved taking points harry, certainly never missed opportunity give punishments, even suggest suspended school 
¡°i don¡¯t care moody says,¡± hermione went 
¡°dumbledore¡¯s stupid 
right trust hagrid professor lupin, even though loads people wouldn¡¯t given jobs, shouldn¡¯t right snape, even snape bit evil,¡± said ron promptly 
¡°come on, hennione, dark wizard catchers searching office, then?¡± ¡°why mr

¡°its bit funny, isn¡¯t it, can¡¯t manage come yule ball, get middle night wants to?¡± ¡°you don¡¯t like crouch elf, winky,¡± said ron, sending cushion soaring window 
¡°you want think snapes something,¡± said hermione, sending cushion zooming neatly box 
¡°i want know snape first chance, he¡¯s second one,¡± said harry grimly, cushion, great surprise, flew straight across room landed neatly top hermione¡¯ 
obedient sirius¡¯s wish hearing anything odd hogwarts, harry sent letter brown owl night, explaining mr 
crouch breaking snape office, moody snape ¡¯s conversation 
harry turned attention earnest urgent problem facing him: survive underwater hour twenty-fourth february 
ron quite liked idea using summoning charm - harry explained aqua-lungs, ron couldn¡¯t see harry shouldn¡¯t summon one nearest muggle town 
hermione squashed plan pointing that, unlikely event harry managed learn operate aqua- lung within set limit hour, sure disqualified breaking international code wizarding secrecy - much hope muggles would spot aqua-lung zooming across countryside hogwarts 
¡°of course, ideal solution would transfigure submarine something,¡± hermione said 
¡°if we¡¯d done human transfiguration already! don¡¯t think start sixth year, go badly wrong don¡¯t know you¡¯re 


¡± ¡°yeah, don¡¯t fancy walking around periscope sticking head,¡± said harry 
¡°i s¡¯pose could always attack someone front moody; might 


¡± ¡°i don¡¯t think he¡¯d let choose wanted turned into, though,¡± said hennione seriously 
¡°no, think best chance sort charm 
¡± harry, thinking would soon enough library last lifetime, buried among dusty volumes, looking spell might enable human survive without oxygen 
however, though he, ron, hermione searched lunchtimes, evenings, whole weekends - though harry asked professor mcgonagall note permission use restricted section, even asked irritable, vulture-like librarian madam pince, help - found nothing whatsoever would enable harry spend hour underwater live tell tale 
familiar flutterings panic starting disturb harry now, finding difficult concentrate class 
lake, harry always taken granted another feature grounds, drew eyes whenever near classroom window, great, iron- gray mass chilly water, whose dark icy depths starting seem distant moon 
faced horntail, time slipping away though somebody bewitched clocks go extra-fast 
week go february twenty-fourth (there still time) 


five days go (he bound find something soon)

harry started go food

pulled parchment, unrolled it, saw shortest letter sirius ever written 
send date next hogsmeade weekend return owl harry turned parchment looked back, hoping see something else, blank 
¡°weekend next,¡± whispered hermione, read note harrys shoulder 
¡°here - take quill send owl back straight away 
¡± harry scribbled dates back sirius¡¯s letter, tied onto brown owl¡¯s leg, watched take flight 
expected? advice survive underwater? intent telling sirius snape moody completely forgotten mention eggs clue 
¡°what¡¯s want know next hogsmeade weekend for?¡± said ron 
¡°dunno,¡± said harry dully 
momentary happiness flared inside sight owl died 
¡°come

¡± whether hagrid trying make blast-ended skrewts, two skrewts left, trying prove could anything professor grubbly-plank could 
harry didnt know, hagrid continuing lessons unicorns ever since he¡¯d returned work

today managed capture two unicorn foals 
unlike full-grown unicorns, pure gold 
parvati lavender went transports delight sight them, even pansy parkinson work hard conceal much liked 
¡°easier ter spot adults,¡± hagrid told class 
¡°they turn silver they¡¯re abou¡¯ two years old, an¡¯ grow horns aroun four

¡°you okay harry?¡± hagrid muttered, moving aside slightly, others swanned around baby unicorns 
¡°yeah,¡± said harry

looked hagrid - perhaps go lake sometimes, deal creatures it? looked everything else grounds, all- ¡°yeh¡¯re goin¡¯ ter win,¡± hagrid growled, patting harrys shoulder again, harry actually felt sink couple inches soft ground 
¡°i know

pretending interested young unicorns, forced smile return, moved forward pat others 
evening second task harry felt though trapped nightmare 
fully aware even if, miracle, managed find suitable spell, he¡¯d real job mastering overnight 
could let happen? hadn¡¯t got work egg¡¯s clue sooner? ever let mind wander class - teacher mentioned breathe underwater? sat hermione ron library sun set outside, tearing feverishly page page spells, hidden one another massive piles books desk front 
harry heart gave huge leap every time saw word ¡°water¡± page, often merely ¡°take two pints water, half pound shredded mandrake leaves, newt 

¡°i don¡¯t reckon done,¡± said rons voice flatly side table 
¡°there¡¯s nothing

closest thing dry puddles ponds, drought chann, nowhere near powerful enough drain lake 
¡± ¡°there must something,¡± hermione muttered, moving candle closer 
eyes tired poring tiny print olde forgotten bewitchments channes nose inch page 
¡°they¡¯d never set task undoable 
¡± ¡°they have,¡± said ron 
¡°harry, go lake tomorrow, right, stick head in, yell merpeople give back whatever they¡¯ve nicked, see chuck

¡± ¡°there¡¯s way it!¡± hennione said crossly 
¡°there be!¡± seemed taking library¡¯s lack useful information subject personal insult; never failed 
¡°i know done,¡± said harry, resting, face-down, saucy tricks tricky sorts 
¡°i should¡¯ve learned animagus like sirius 
¡± animagus wizard could transfonn animal 
¡°yeah, could¡¯ve turned goldfish time wanted!¡± said ron 
¡°or frog,¡± yawned harry 
exhausted 
¡°it takes years become animagus, register everything,¡± said hermione vaguely, squinting index weird wizarding dilemmas solutions 
¡°professor mcgonagall told us, remember

¡± ¡°hermione, joking,¡± said harry wearily 
¡°i know haven¡¯t got chance turning frog tomorrow morning 


¡± ¡°oh use,¡± hennione said, snapping shut weird wizarding dilemmas 
¡°who earth wants make nose hair grow ringlets?¡± ¡°i wouldn¡¯t mind,¡± said fred weasleys voice 
¡°be talking point, wouldn¡¯t it?¡± harry, ron, hennione looked 
fred george emerged behind bookshelves 
¡°what¡¯re two here?¡± ron asked 
¡°looking you,¡± said george 
¡°mcgonagall wants you, ron

¡± ¡°why?¡± said hennione, looking surprised 
¡°dunno 


looking bit grim, though,¡± said fred 
¡°we¡¯re supposed take office,¡± said george 
ron hermione stared harry, felt stomach drop 
professor mcgonagall tell ron hermione off? perhaps she¡¯d noticed much helping him, ought working task alone? ¡°we¡¯ll meet back common room,¡± hennione told harry got go ron - looked anxious 
¡°bring many books can, okay?¡± ¡°right,¡± said harry uneasily 
eight o¡¯clock madam pince extinguished lamps came chivvy harry library 
staggering weight many books could carry, harry returned gryffindor common room, pulled table corner, continued search 
nothing madcap magic wacky warlocks 


nothing guide medieval sorcery 


one mention underwater exploits anthology eighteenth-century charms, dreadful denizens deep, powers never knew youve wised 
crookshanks crawled harrys lap curled up, purring deeply 
common room emptied slowly around harry 
people kept wishing luck next morning cheery, confident voices like hagrid s, apparently convinced pull another stunning performance like one managed first task 
harry couldn¡¯t answer them, nodded, feeling though golfball stuck throat 
ten midnight, alone room crooksha nk 
searched remaining books, ron hermione come back

forgetting crookshanks lap 
harry stood suddenly; crookshanks hissed angrily landed floor, gave harry disgusted look, stalked away bottlebrush tail air, harry already hurrying spiral staircase dormitory

¡°lumos,¡± harry whispered fifteen minutes later opened library door

¡°dobby quite sure, sir!¡± said elf earnestly 
¡°dobby hears things, sir, house-elf, goes castle lights fires mops floors 
dobby heard professor mcgonagall professor moody staffroom, talking next task 


dobby cannot let harry potter lose wheezy!¡± harrys doubts vanished 
jumping feet pulled invisibility cloak, stuffed bag, grabbed gillyweed, put pocket, tore library dobby heels 
¡°dobby supposed kitchens, sir!¡± dobby squealed burst corridor 
¡°dobby missed - good luck, harry potter, sir, good luck!¡± ¡°see later, dobby!¡± harry shouted, sprinted along corridor stairs, three time 
entrance hall contained last-minute stragglers, leaving great hall breakfast heading double oak doors watch second task 
stared harry flashed past, sending colin dennis creevey flying leapt stone steps onto bright, chilly grounds 
pounded lawn saw seats encircled dragons¡¯ enclosure november ranged along opposite bank, rising stands packed bursting point reflected lake 
excited babble crowd echoed strangely across water harry ran flat-out around side lake toward judges, sitting another golddraped table water¡¯s edge 
cedric, fleur, krum beside judges¡¯ table, watching harry sprint toward 
¡°i¡¯m 





¡± harry panted, skidding halt mud accidentally splattering fleurs robes 
¡°where been?¡± said bossy, disapproving voice 
¡°the task¡¯s start!¡± harry looked around 
percy weasley sitting judges¡¯ table - mr 
crouch failed turn 
¡°now, now, percy!¡± said ludo bagman, looking intensely relieved see harry 
¡°let catch breath!¡± dumbledore smiled harry, karkaroff madame maxime didn¡¯t look pleased see 


obvious looks faces thought wasn¡¯t going turn 
harry bent over, hands knees, gasping breath; stitch side felt though knife ribs, time get rid it; ludo bagman moving among champions, spacing along bank intervals ten feet 
harry end line, next krum, wearing swimming trunks holding wand ready 
¡°all right 
harry?¡± bagman whispered moved harry feet farther away krum 
¡°know you¡¯re going do?¡± ¡°yeah,¡± harry panted, massaging ribs 
bagman gave harry¡¯s shoulder quick squeeze returned judges¡¯ table; pointed wand throat done world cup, said, ¡°sonorus!¡± voice boomed across dark water toward stands 
¡°well, champions ready second task, start whistle 
precisely hour recover taken 
count three, 
one 


two 


three!¡± whistle echoed shrilly cold, still air; stands erupted cheers applause; without looking see champions doing, harry pulled shoes socks, pulled handful gillyweed pocket, stuffed mouth, waded lake 
cold felt skin legs searing though fire, icy water 
sodden robes weighed walked deeper; water knees, rapidly numbing feet slipping silt flat, slimy stones 
chewing gillyweed hard fast could; felt unpleasantly slimy rubbery, like octopus tentacles 
waist-deep freezing water stopped, swallowed, waited something happen 
could hear laughter crowd knew must look stupid, walking lake without showing sign magical power 
part still dry covered goose pimples; half immersed icy water, cruel breeze lifting hair, harry started shiver violently 
avoided looking stands; laughter becoming louder, catcalls jeering slytherins 


then, quite suddenly, harry felt though invisible pillow pressed mouth nose 
tried draw breath, made head spin; lungs empty, suddenly felt piercing pain either side neck - harry clapped hands around throat felt two large slits ears, flapping cold air 


gills 
without pausing think, thing made sense - flung forward water 
first gulp icy lake water felt like breath life 
head stopped spinning; took another great gulp water felt pass smoothly gills, sending oxygen back brain 
stretched hands front stared 
looked green ghostly water, become webbed 
twisted around looked bare feet - become elongated toes webbed too: looked though sprouted flippers 
water didn¡¯t feel icy anymore either 


contrary, felt pleasantly cool light 


harry struck more, marveling far fast flipper-like feet propelled vater, noticing clearly could see, longer seemed need blink 
soon swum far lake could longer see bottom 
flipped dived depths 
silence pressed upon ears soared strange, dark, foggy landscape 
could see ten feet around him, sped throuugh water new scenes seemed loom suddenly incoming darkness: forests rippling, tangled black weed, wide plains mud littered dull, glimmering stones 
swam deeper deeper, toward middle lake, eyes wide, staring eerily gray-lit water around shadow beyond, water became opaque 
small fish flickered past like silver darts 
twice thought saw something larger moving ahead him, got nearer, discovered nothing large, blackened log, dense clump weed 
sign champions, merpeople, ron - nor, thankfully, giant squid 
light green weed stretched ahead far could see, two feet deep, like meadow overgrown grass 
harry staring unblinkingly ahead him, trying discern shapes gloom 


then, without warning, something grabbed hold ankle 
harry twisted body around saw grindylow, small, horned water demon, poking weed, long fingers clutched tightly around harry¡¯s leg, pointed fangs bared - harry stuck webbed hand quickly inside robes fumbled wand 
time grasped it, two grindylows risen weed, seized handfuls harry¡¯s robes, attempting drag 
¡°relashio!¡± harry shouted, except sound came 


large bubble issued mouth, wand, instead sending sparks grindylows, pelted seemed jet boiling water, struck them, angry red patches appeared green skin 
harry pulled ankle grindylows grip swam, fast could, occasionally sending jets hot water shoulder random; every felt one grindylows snatch foot again, kicked out, hard; finally, felt foot connect horned skull, looking back, saw dazed grindylow floating away, cross-eyed, fellows shook fists harry sank back weed 
harry slowed little, slipped wand back inside robes, looked around, listening 
turned full circle water, silence pressing harder ever eardrums 
knew must even deeper lake now, nothing moving rippling weed 
¡°how getting on?¡± harry thought heart attack 
whipped around saw moaning myrtle floating hazily front him, gazing thick, pearly glasses 
¡°myrtle!¡± harry tried shout - again, nothing came mouth large bubble 
moaning myrtle actually giggled 
¡°you want try there!¡± said, pointing 
¡°i won¡¯t come 


don¡¯t like much, always chase get close 


¡± harry gave thumbs-up show thanks set more, careful swim bit higher weed avoid grindylows might lurking 
swam felt like least twenty minutes 
passing vast expanses black mud now, swirled murkily disturbed water 
then, long last, heard snatch haunting mersong 
¡°an hour long look, recover took 


¡± harry swam faster soon saw large rock emerge muddy water ahead 
paintings merpeople it; carrying spears chasing looked like giant squid 
harry swam past rock, following mersong 
¡° 


time's half gone, tarty lest seek stays rot 


¡± cluster crude stone dwellings stained algae loomed suddenly gloom sides 
dark windows, harry saw faces 


faces bore resemblance painting mermaid prefects¡¯ bathroom 


merpeople grayish skin long, wild, dark green hair 
eyes yellow, broken teeth, wore thick ropes pebbles around necks 
leered harry swam past; one two emerged caves watch better, powerful, silver fish tails beating water, spears clutched hands 
harry sped on, staring around, soon dwellings became numerous; gardens weed around them, even saw pet grindylow tied stake outside one door 
merpeople emerging sides now, watching eagerly, pointing webbed hands gills, talking behind hands one another 
harry sped around corner strange sight met eyes 
whole crowd merpeople floating front houses lined looked like mer-version village square 
choir merpeople singing middle, calling champions toward them, behind rose crude sort statue; gigantic merperson hewn boulder 
four people bound tightly tail stone merperson 
ron tied hennione cho chang 
also girl looked older eight, whose clouds silvery hair made harry feel sure fleur delacour¡¯s sister 
four appeared deep sleep 
heads lolling onto shoulders, fine streams bubbles kept issuing mouths 
harry sped toward hostages, half expecting merpeople lower spears charge him, nothing 
ropes weed tying hostages statue thick, slimy, strong 
fleeting second thought knife sirius bought christmas - locked trunk castle quarter mile away, use whatsoever 
looked around 
many merpeople surrounding carrying spears 
swam swiftly toward seven-foot-tall merman long green beard choker shark fangs tried mime request borrow spear 
merman laughed shook head 
¡°we help,¡± said harsh, croaky voice 
¡°come on!¡± harry said fiercely (but bubbles issued mouth), tried pull spear away merman, merman yanked back, still shaking head laughing 
harry swirled around, staring 
something sharp 


anything 


rocks littering lake bottom 
dived snatched particularly jagged one returned statue 
began hack ropes binding ron, several minutes¡¯ hard work, broke apart 
ron floated, unconscious, inches lake bottom, drifting little ebb water 
harry looked around 
sign champions 
playing at? didn¡¯t hurry up? turned back hennione, raised jagged rock, began hack bindings - once, several pairs strong gray hands seized 
half dozen mermen pulling away hennione, shaking green-haired heads, laughing 
¡°you take hostage,¡± one said 
¡°leave others 


¡± ¡°no way!¡± said harry furiously - two large bubbles came 
¡°your task retrieve friend 


leave others 


¡± ¡°she¡¯s friend too!¡± harry yelled, gesturing toward hennione, enormous silver bubble emerging soundlessly lips 
¡°and don¡¯t want die either!¡± cho¡¯s head hermiones shoulder; small silver-haired girl ghostly green pale 
hany struggled fight mermen, laughed harder ever, holding back 
hany looked wildly around 
champions? would time take ron surface come back hennione others? would able find again? looked watch see much time left - stopped working 
merpeople around pointed excitedly head 
hany looked saw cedric swimming toward 
enormous bubble around head, made features look oddly wide stretched 
¡°got lost!¡± mouthed, looking panic-stricken 
¡°fleur krum¡¯re coming now!¡± feeling enormously relieved, harry watched cedric pull knife pocket cut cho free 
pulled upward sight 
harry looked around, waiting 
fleur krum? time getting short, according song, hostages would lost hour 


merpeople started screeching animatedly 
holding harry loosened grip, staring behind 
harry turned saw something monstrous cutting water toward them: human body swimming trunks head shark 


krum 
appeared transfigured himself- badly 
shark-man swam straight hermione began snapping biting ropes; trouble krum¡¯s new teeth positioned awkwardly biting anything smaller dolphin, harry quite sure krum wasn¡¯t careful, going rip hennione half 
darting forward harry hit krum hard shoulder held jagged stone 
krum seized began cut hermione free 
within seconds, done it; grabbed hennione around waist, without backward glance, began rise rapidly toward surface 
what? harry thought desperately 
could sure fleur coming 


still sign 
nothing done except 


snatched stone, krum dropped, mermen closed around ron little girl, shaking heads 
harry pulled wand 
¡°get way!¡± bubbles flew mouth, distinct impression mennen understood him, suddenly stopped laughing 
yellowish eyes fixed upon harry¡¯s wand, looked scared 
might lot him, harry could tell, looks faces, knew magic giant squid 
¡°you¡¯ve got three!¡± harry shouted; great stream bubbles burst him, held three fingers make sure got message 
¡°one 


¡± (he put finger) ¡°two 


¡± (he put second one) - scattered 
harry darted forward began hack ropes binding small girl statue, last free 
seized little girl around waist, grabbed neck rons robes, kicked bottom 
slow work 
could longer use webbed hands propel forward; worked flippers furiously, ron fleur¡¯s sister like potato-filled sacks dragging back 


fixed eyes skyward, though knew must still deep, water dark 


merpeople rising 
could see swirling around ease, watching struggle water 


would pull back depths time up? perhaps eat humans? harry¡¯s legs seizing effort keep swimming; shoulders aching horribly effort dragging ron girl 


drawing breath extreme difficulty 
could feel pain sides neck 


becoming aware wet water mouth 


yet darkness definitely thinning 


could see daylight 


kicked hard flippers discovered nothing feet 


water flooding mouth lungs 


starting feel dizzy, knew light air ten feet

harry kicked legs hard fast felt though muscles screaming protest; brain felt waterlogged, couldn¡¯t breathe, needed oxygen, keep going, could stop - felt head break surface lake; wonderful, cold, clear air making wet face sting; gulped down, feeling though never breathed properly before, and, panting, pulled ron little girl 
around him, wild, green-haired heads emerging water him, smiling 
crowd stands making great deal noise; shouting screaming, seemed feet; harry impression thought ron little girl might dead, wrong 


opened eyes; girl looked scared confused, ron merely expelled great spout water, blinked bright light, turned harry, said, ¡°wet, this, isn¡¯t it?¡± spotted fleur¡¯s sister 
¡°what bring for?¡± ¡°fleur didn¡¯t turn up, couldn¡¯t leave her,¡± harry panted 
¡°harry, prat,¡± said ron, ¡°you didn¡¯t take song thing seriously, you? dumbledore wouldn¡¯t let us drown!¡± ¡°the song said ¡°it make sure got back inside time limit!¡± said ron 
¡°i hope didn¡¯t waste time acting hero!¡± harry felt stupid annoyed 
well ron; he¡¯d asleep, hadn¡¯t felt eerie lake, surrounded spear-carrying merpeople who¡¯d looked capable murder 
¡°c¡¯mon,¡± harry said shortly, ¡°help her, don¡¯t think swim well

judge left table; judge showing signs pleasure relief harry, ron, fleur¡¯s sister got back safely 
¡°yeah, that¡¯s right,¡± said harry, raising voice slightly karkaroff could hear 
¡°you haff water beetle hair, herm-own-ninny,¡± said krum 
harry impression krum drawing attention back onto himself; perhaps remind rescued lake, hennione brushed away beetle impatiently said, ¡°you¡¯re well outside time limit, though, harry

cedric krum hadn¡¯t wasted time worrying anyone else; hadn¡¯t taken mersong seriously 


dumbledore crouching water¡¯s edge, deep conversation seemed chief merperson, particularly wild ferocious-looking female 
making sort screechy noises merpeople made water; clearly, dumbledore could speak mermish 
finally straightened up, turned fellow judges, said, ¡°a conference give marks, think 
¡± judges went huddle 
madam pomfrey gone rescue ron percy¡¯s clutches; led harry others, gave blanket pepperup potion, went fetch fleur sister 
fleur many cuts face arms robes torn, didn¡¯t seem care, would allow madam pomfrey clean

cottages fewer here, gardens larger; walking toward foot mountain whose shadow hogsmeade lay 
turned comer saw stile end lane

tethered end it, one end rope around large rock, buckbeak hippogriff 
half gray horse, half giant eagle, buckbeak¡¯s fierce orange eye flashed sight 
three bowed low him, regarding imperiously moment, buckbeak bent scaly front knees allowed hennione rush forward stroke feathery neck 
harry, however, looking black dog, turned godfather 
sirius wearing ragged gray robes; ones wearing left azkaban

¡°he says crouch suffering overwork 
¡± ¡°mind you, look ill, last time saw close,¡± said harry slowly, still reading story 
¡°the night name came goblet

stroking buckbeak, crunching sirius¡¯s chicken bones 
¡°i bet wishes hadn¡¯t done - bet feels difference she¡¯s look

¡± ¡°the malfoys!¡± said ron suddenly, loudly voice echoed around cave, buckbeak tossed head nervously 
¡°i bet lucius malfoy!¡± ¡°anyone else?¡± said sirius 
¡°no one,¡± said harry 
¡°yes, was, ludo bagman,¡± hennione reminded 
¡°oh yeah

¡°i wonder he¡¯d that?¡± ¡°says he¡¯s taken liking me,¡± said harry 
¡°hmm,¡± said sirius, looking thoughtful 
¡°we saw forest dark mark appeared,¡± hennione told sirius

¡°all absences barty crouch¡¯s

it¡¯s like crouch 
he¡¯s ever taken day work illness this, i¡¯ll eat buckbeak 
¡± ¡°d¡¯you know crouch, then?¡± said harry 
sirius¡¯s face darkened 
suddenly looked menacing night harry first met him, night harry still believed sirius murderer 
¡°oh know crouch right,¡± said quietly 
¡°he one gave order sent azkaban - without trial 
¡± ¡°what?¡± said ron hermione together 
¡°you¡¯re kidding!¡± said harry 
¡°no, i¡¯m not,¡± said sirius, taking another great bite chicken 
¡°crouch used head department magical law enforcement, didn¡¯t know?¡± harry, ron, hermione shook heads 
¡°he tipped next minister magic,¡± said sirius 
¡°he¡¯s great wizard, barty crouch, powerfully magical - power-hungry 
oh never voldemort supporter,¡± said, reading look harrys face 
¡°no, barty crouch always outspoken dark side 
lot people dark side 


well, wouldn¡¯t understand

¡± ¡°that¡¯s dad said world cup,¡± said ron, trace irritation voice 
¡°try us, don¡¯t you?¡± grin flashed across sirius¡¯s thin face 
¡°all right, i¡¯ll try 

walked cave, back again, said, ¡°imagine voldemort¡¯s powerful 
don¡¯t know supporters are, don¡¯t know who¡¯s working isn¡¯t; know control people terrible things without able stop 
you¡¯re scared yourself, family, friends 
every week, news comes deaths, disappearances, torturing 


ministry magic¡¯s disarray, don¡¯t know do, they¡¯re trying keep everything hidden muggles, meanwhile, muggles dying 
terror everywhere 


panic 


confusion 


that¡¯s used 
¡°well, times like bring best people worst others 
crouch¡¯s principles might¡¯ve good beginning - 1 wouldn¡¯t know 
rose quickly ministry, started ordering harsh measures voldemorts supporters 
aurors given new powers - powers kill rather capture, instance 
wasn¡¯t one handed straight dementors without trial 
crouch fought violence violence, authorized use unforgivable curses suspects 
would say became ruthless cruel many dark side 
supporters, mind - plenty people thought going things right way, lot witches wizards clamoring take minister magic 
voldemort disappeared, looked like matter time crouch got top job 
something rather unfortunate happened 


¡± sirius smiled grimly 
¡°crouch¡¯s son caught group death eaters who¡¯d managed talk way azkaban 
apparently trying find voldemort return power 
¡± ¡°crouch¡¯s son caught?¡± gasped hennione 
¡°yep,¡± said sirius, throwing chicken bone buckbeak, flinging back ground beside loaf bread, tearing half 
¡°nasty little shock old barty, i¡¯d imagine 
spent bit time home family, shouldn¡¯t he? ought left office early 


gotten know son 
¡± began wolf large pieces bread 
¡°was son death eater?¡± said harry 
¡°no idea,¡± said sirius, still stuffing bread 
¡°i azkaban brought 
mostly stuff i¡¯ve found since got 
boy definitely caught company people i¡¯d bet life death eaters - might wrong place wrong time, like house-elf 
¡± ¡°did crouch try get son off?¡± hennione whispered 
sirius let laugh much like bark 
¡°crouch let son off? thought measure him, hennione! anything threatened tarnish reputation go; dedicated whole life becoming minister magic 
saw dismiss devoted house-elf associated dark mark - doesn¡¯t tell he¡¯s like? crouch¡¯s fatherly affection stretched far enough give son trial, accounts, wasn¡¯t much excuse crouch show much hated boy 


sent straight azkaban 
¡± ¡°he gave son dementors?¡± asked harry quietly 
¡°that¡¯s right,¡± said sirius, didn¡¯t look remotely amused 
¡°i saw dementors bringing in, watched bars cell door 
can¡¯t nineteen 
took cell near mine 
screaming mother nightfall 
went quiet days, though 


went quiet end 


except shrieked sleep 


¡± moment, deadened look sirius¡¯s eyes became pronounced ever, though shutters closed behind 
¡°so he¡¯s still azkaban?¡± harry said 
¡°no,¡± said sirius dully 
¡°no, he¡¯s anymore 
died year brought 
¡± ¡°he died?¡± ¡°he wasn¡¯t one,¡± said sirius bitterly 
¡°most go mad there, plenty stop eating end 
lose live 
could always tell death coming, dementors could sense it, got excited 
boy looked pretty sickly arrived 
crouch important ministry member, wife allowed deathbed visit 
last time saw barty crouch, half carrying wife past cell 
died herself, apparently, shortly afterward 
grief 
wasted away like boy 
crouch never came sons body 
dementors buried outside fortress; watched 
¡± sirius threw aside bread lifted mouth instead picked flask pumpkin juice drained 
¡°so old crouch lost all, thought made,¡± continued, wiping mouth back hand 
¡°one moment, hero, poised become minister magic 


next, son dead, wife dead, family name dishonored, and, i¡¯ve heard since escaped, big drop popularity 
boy died, people started feeling bit sympathetic toward son started asking nice young lad good family gone badly astray 
conclusion father never cared much 
cornelius fudge got top job, crouch shunted sideways department international magical cooperation 
¡± long silence 
harry thinking way crouch¡¯s eyes bulged he¡¯d looked disobedient house-elf back wood quidditch world cup 
this, then, must crouch overreacted winky found beneath dark mark 
brought back memories son, old scandal, fall grace ministry 
¡°moody says crouch obsessed catching dark wizards,¡± harry told sirius 
¡°yeah, i¡¯ve heard it¡¯s become bit mania him,¡± said sirius, nodding 
¡°if ask me, still thi nk bring back old popularity catching one death eater 
¡± ¡°and sneaked search snape¡¯s office!¡± said ron triumphantly, looking hennione 
¡°yes, doesn¡¯t make sense all,¡± said sirius 
¡°yeah, does!¡± said ron excitedly, sirius shook head 
¡°listen, crouch wants investigate snape, hasn¡¯t coming judge tournament? would ideal excuse make regular visits hogwarts keep eye 
¡± ¡°so think snape could something, then?¡± asked harry, hennione broke 
¡°look, don¡¯t care say, dumbledore trusts snape ¡°oh give rest, hennione,¡± said ron impatiently 
¡°i know dumbledores brilliant everything, doesn¡¯t mean really clever dark wizard couldn¡¯t fool ¡°why snape save harry¡¯s life first year, then? didn¡¯t let die?¡± ¡°i dunno - maybe thought dumbledore would kick out-¡± ¡°what d¡¯you think, sirius?¡± harry said loudly, ron hennione stopped bickering listen 
¡°i think they¡¯ve got point,¡± said sirius, looking thoughtfully ron hennione 
¡°ever since found snape teaching here, i¡¯ve wondered dumbledore hired 
snape¡¯s always fascinated dark arts, famous school 
slimy, oily, greasy- haired kid, was,¡± sirius added, harry ron grinned 
¡°snape knew curses anived school half kids seventh year, part gang slytherins nearly turned death eaters 
¡± sirius held fingers began ticking names 
¡°rosier wilkes - killed aurors year voldemort fell 
lestranges - they¡¯re married couple - they¡¯re azkaban 
avery - i¡¯ve heard wormed way trouble saying he¡¯d acting imperius curse - he¡¯s still large 
far know, snape never even accused death eater - means much 
plenty never caught 
snape certainly clever cunning enough keep trouble 
¡± ¡°snape knows karkaroff pretty well, wants keep quiet,¡± said ron 
¡°yeah, should¡¯ve seen snape¡¯s face karkaroff turned potions yesterday!¡± said harry quickly 
¡°karkaroff wanted talk snape, says snape¡¯s avoiding 
karkaroff looked really worried 
showed snape something ann, couldn¡¯t see 
¡± ¡°he showed snape something arm?¡± said sirius, looking frankly bewildered 
ran fingers distractedly filthy hair, shrugged 
¡°well, i¡¯ve idea that¡¯s 


karkaroff genuinely worried, he¡¯s going snape answers 


¡± sirius stared cave wall, made grimace frustration 
¡°there¡¯s still fact dumbledore trusts snape, know dumbledore trusts lot people wouldn¡¯t, can¡¯t see letting snape teach hogwarts he¡¯d ever worked voldemort 
¡± ¡°why moody crouch keen get snapes office then?¡± said ron stubbornly 
¡°well,¡± said sirius slowly, ¡°i wouldn¡¯t put past mad-eye searched every single teacher¡¯s office got hogwarts 
takes defense dark arts seriously, moody 
i¡¯m sure trusts anyone all, things he¡¯s seen, it¡¯s surprising 
i¡¯ll say moody, though, never killed could help 
always brought people alive possible 
tough, never descended level death eaters 
crouch, though 


he¡¯s different matter 


really ill? is, make effort drag snape¡¯s office? he¡¯s 


what¡¯s to? world cup important didn¡¯t turn top box? what¡¯s judging tournament?¡± sirius lapsed silence, still staring cave wall

¡°it found him, not?¡± ¡°yes,¡± said harry 
then, feeling pointless pretend hadn¡¯t overheard saying, added, ¡°i didn¡¯t see madame maxime anywhere, though, she¡¯d job hiding, wouldn¡¯t she?¡± dumbledore smiled harry behind fudge¡¯s back, eyes twinkling 
¡°yes, well,¡± said fudge, looking embarrassed, ¡°we¡¯re go short walk grounds, harry, you¡¯ll excuse us 


perhaps go back class ¡°i wanted talk 
professor,¡± harry said quickly, looking dumbledore, gave swift, searching look 
¡°wait me, harry,¡± said 
¡°our examination grounds take long 
¡± trooped silence past closed door 
minute so, harry heard clunks moody¡¯s wooden leg growing fainter corridor 
looked around 
¡°hello, fawkes,¡± said 
fawkes, professor dumbledore¡¯s phoenix, standing golden perch beside door 
size swan, magnificent scarlet-and-gold plumage, swished long tail blinked benignly harry 
harry sat chair front dumbledore¡¯s desk 
several minutes, sat watched old headmasters headmistresses snoozing frames, thinking heard, running fingers scar 
stopped hurting 
felt much calmer, somehow, dumbledore¡¯s office, knowing would shortly telling dream 
harry looked walls behind desk 
patched ragged sorting hat standing shelf 
glass case next held magnificent silver sword large rubies set hilt, harry recognized one pulled sorting hat second year 
sword belonged godric gryffindor, founder harry¡¯s house 
gazing it, remembering come aid thought hope lost, noticed patch silvery light, dancing shimmering glass case 
looked around source light saw sliver silver-white shining brightly within black cabinet behind him, whose door closed properly 
harry hesitated, glanced fawkes, got up, walked across office, pulled open cabinet door 
shallow stone basin lay there, odd carvings around edge: runes symbols harry recognize 
silvery light coming basin¡¯s contents, like nothing harry ever seen 
could tell whether substance liquid gas 
bright, whitish silver, moving ceaselessly; surface became ruffled like water beneath wind, then, like clouds, separated swirled smoothly 
looked like light made liquid - like wind made solid - harry couldn¡¯t make mind 
wanted touch it, find felt like, nearly four years¡¯ experience magical world told sticking hand bowl full unknown substance stupid thing 
therefore pulled wand inside robes, cast nervous look around office, looked back contents basin, prodded 
surface silvery stuff inside basin began swirl fast 
harry bent closer, head right inside cabinet 
silvery substance become transparent; looked like glass 
looked expecting see stone bottom basin - saw instead enormous room surface mysterious substance, room seemed looking circular window ceiling 
room dimly lit; thought might even underground, windows, merely torches brackets ones illuminated walls hogwarts 
lowering face nose mere inch away glassy substance, harry saw rows rows witches wizards seated around every wall seemed benches rising levels 
empty chair stood center room 
something chair gave harry ominous feeling 
chains encircled arms it, though occupants usually tied 
place? surely wasn¡¯t hogwarts; never seen room like castle 
moreover, crowd mysterious room bottom basin comprised adults, harry knew nearly many teachers hogwarts 
seemed, thought, waiting something; even though could see tops hats, faces seemed pointing one direction, none talking one another 
basin circular, room observing square, harry could make going corners 
leaned even closer, tilting head, trying see 


tip nose touched strange substance staring 
dumbledore¡¯s office gave almighty lurch - harry thrown forward pitched headfirst substance inside basin - head hit stone bottom 
falling something icycold black; like sucked dark whirlpool - suddenly, harry found sitting bench end room inside basin, bench raised high others 
looked high stone ceiling, expecting see circular window staring, nothing dark, solid stone 
breathing hard fast harry looked around 
one witches wizards room (and least two hundred them) looking 
one seemed noticed fourteen-year-old boy dropped ceiling midst 
harry turned wizard next bench uttered loud cry surprise reverberated around silent room 
sitting right next albus dumbledore 
¡°professor!¡± harry said kind strangled whisper 
¡°i¡¯m sorry - 1 didn¡¯t mean - 1 looking basin cabinet - 1 - we?¡± dumbledore didn¡¯t move speak 
ignored harry completely 
like every wizard benches, staring far comer room, door 
harry gazed, nonplussed, dumbledore, around silently watchful crowd, back dumbledore 
dawned 


harry found somewhere nobody could see hear 
time, fallen page enchanted diary, right somebody else¡¯s memory 


unless much mistaken, something sort happened 


harry raised right hand, hesitated, waved energetically dumbledore¡¯s face 
dumbledore blink, look around harry, indeed move 
that, harry¡¯s opinion, settled matter 
dumbledore wouldn¡¯t ignore like 
inside memory, present-day dumbledore 
yet couldn¡¯t long ago 


dumbledore sitting next silver-haired, like present-day dumbledore 
place? wizards waiting for? harry looked around carefully 
room, suspected observing above, almost certainly underground - dungeon room, thought 
bleak forbidding air place; pictures walls, decorations all; serried rows benches, rising levels around room, positioned clear view chair chains arms 
harry could reach conclusions place were, heard footsteps 
door corner dungeon opened three people entered - least one man, flanked two dementors 
harry¡¯s insides went cold 
dementors - tall, hooded creatures whose faces concealed - gliding slowly toward chair center room, grasping one man¡¯s anns dead rotten-looking hands 
man looked though faint, harry couldn¡¯t blame 


knew dementors could touch inside memory, remembered power well 
watching crowd recoiled slightly dementors placed man chained chair glided back room 
door swung shut behind 
harry looked man sitting chair saw karkaroff 
unlike dumbledore, karkaroff looked much younger; hair goatee black 
dressed sleek furs, thin ragged robes 
shaking 
even harry watched, chains arms chair glowed suddenly gold snaked way karkaroff arms, binding 
¡°igor karkaroff,¡± said curt voice harry¡¯s left 
harry looked around saw mr 
crouch standing middle bench beside 
crouch¡¯s hair dark, face much less lined, looked fit alert 
¡°you brought azkaban present evidence ministry magic 
given us understand important information us 
¡± karkaroff straightened best could, tightly bound chair 
¡°i have, sir,¡± said, although voice scared, harry could still hear familiar unctuous note 
¡°i wish use ministry 
wish help 
- 1 know ministry trying - round last dark lords supporters 
eager assist way 


¡± murmur around benches 
wizards witches surveying karkaroff interest, others pronounced mistrust 
harry heard, quite distinctly, dumbledores side, familiar, growling voice saying, ¡°filth 
¡± harry leaned forward could see past dumbledore 
mad-eye moody sitting - except noticeable difference appearance 
magical eye, two normal ones 
looking upon karkaroff, narrowed intense dislike 
¡°crouch going let out,¡± moody breathed quietly dumbledore 
¡°he¡¯s done deal 
took six months track down, crouch going let go he¡¯s got enough new names 
let¡¯s hear information, say, throw straight back dementors 
¡± dumbledore made small noise dissent long, crooked nose 
¡°ah, forgetting 


don¡¯t like dementors, you, albus?¡± said moody sardonic smile 
¡°no,¡± said dumbledore calmly, ¡°i¡¯m afraid don¡¯t 
long felt ministry wrong ally creatures 
¡± ¡°but filth like 

moody said softly 
¡°you say names us, karkaroff,¡± said mr 
crouch 
¡°let us hear them, please 
¡± ¡°you must understand,¡± said karkaroff hurriedly, ¡°that he-who-must-not-be-named operated always greatest secrecy 


preferred - 1 mean say, supporters - regret now, deeply, ever counted among ¡°get it,¡± sneered moody 
never knew names every one fellows - alone knew exactly ¡°which wise move, wasn¡¯t it, prevented someone like you, karkaroff, turning in,¡± muttered moody 
¡°yet say names us?¡± said mr 
crouch 
¡°i - 1 do,¡± said karkaroff breathlessly 
¡°and important supporters, mark 
people saw eyes bidding 
give infonnation sign fully totally renounce him, filled remorse deep barely ¡°these names are?¡± said mr 
crouch sharply 
karkaroff drew deep breath 
¡°there antonin dolohov,¡± said 
¡°i - 1 saw torture countless muggles - non- supporters dark lord 
¡± ¡°and helped it,¡± murmured moody 
¡°we already apprehended dolohov,¡± said crouch 
¡°he caught shortly 
¡± ¡°indeed?¡± said karkaroff, eyes widening 
¡°i - 1 delighted hear it!¡± didn¡¯t look 
harry could tell news come real blow 
one names worthless 
¡°any others?¡± said crouch coldly 
¡°why, yes 


rosier,¡± said karkaroff hurriedly 
¡°evan rosier 
¡± ¡°rosier dead,¡± said crouch 
¡°he caught shortly 
preferred fight rather come quietly killed struggle 
¡± ¡°took bit him, though,¡± whispered moody harry¡¯s right 
harry looked around more, saw indicating large chu nk nose dumbledore 
¡°no - rosier deserved!¡± said karkaroff, real note panic voice 
harry could see starting worry none information would use ministry 
karkaroff eyes darted toward door corner, behind dementors undoubtedly still stood, waiting 
¡°any more?¡± said crouch 
¡°yes!¡± said karkaroff 
¡°there travers - helped murder mckinnons! mulciber - specialized imperius curse, forced countless people horrific things! rookwood, spy, passed he-who-must-not-be-named useful information inside ministry itself¡± ¡® harry could tell that, time, karkaroff struck gold 
watching crowd murmuring together 
¡°rookwood?¡± said mr 
crouch, nodding witch sitting front him, began scribbling upon piece parchment 
¡°augustus rookwood department mysteries?¡± ¡°the same,¡± said karkaroff eagerly 
¡°i believe used network wellplaced wizards, inside ministry out, collect infonnation ¡°but travers mulciber have,¡± said mr 
crouch 
¡°very well, karkaroff, all, returned azkaban decide ¡°not yet!¡± cried karkaroff, looking quite desperate 
¡°wait, more!¡± harry could see sweating torchlight, white skin contrasting strongly black hair beard 
¡°snape!¡± shouted 
¡°severus snape!¡± ¡°snape cleared council,¡± said crouch disdainfully 
¡°he vouched albus dumbledore 
¡± ¡°no!¡± shouted karkaroff, straining chains bound chair 
¡°i assure you! severus snape death eater!¡± dumbledore gotten feet 
¡°i given evidence already matter,¡± said calmly 
¡°severus snape indeed death eater 
however, rejoined side lord voldemort¡¯s downfall turned spy us, great personal risk 
death eater 
¡± harry turned look mad-eye moody 
wearing look deep skepticism behind dumbledore¡¯ back 
¡°very well, karkaroff,¡± crouch said coldly, ¡°you assistance 
shall review case 
return azkaban meantime 

mr 
crouch¡¯s voice faded 
harry looked around; dungeon dissolving though made smoke; everything fading; could see body - else swirling darkness 


then, dungeon returned 
harry sitting different seat, still highest bench, left side mr 
crouch 
atmosphere seemed quite different: relaxed, even cheerful 
witches wizards around walls talking one another, almost though sort sporting event 
harry noticed witch halfway rows benches opposite 
short blonde hair, wearing magenta robes, sucking end acid-green quill 
was, unmistakably, younger rita skeeter 
harry looked around; dumbledore sitting beside again, wearing different robes 
mr 
crouch looked tired somehow fiercer, gaunter 


harry understood 
different memory, different day 


different trial 
door corner opened, ludo bagman walked room 
not, however, ludo bagman gone seed, ludo bagman clearly height quidditch-playing fitness 
nose wasn¡¯t broken now; tall lean muscular 
bagman looked nervous sat chained chair, bind bound karkaroff, bagman, perhaps taking heart this, glanced around watching crowd, waved couple them, managed small smile 
¡°ludo bagman, brought front council magical law answer charges relating activities death eaters,¡± said mr 
crouch 
¡°we heard evidence you, reach verdict 
anything add testimony pronounce judgment?¡± harry couldn¡¯t believe ears 
ludo bagman, death eater? ¡°only,¡± said bagman, smiling awkwardly, ¡°well - 1 know i¡¯ve bit idiot one two wizards witches surrounding seats smiled indulgently 
mr 
crouch appear share feelings 
staring ludo bagman expression utmost severity dislike 
¡°you never spoke truer word, boy,¡± someone muttered dryly dumbledore behind harry 
looked around saw moody sitting 
¡°if didn¡¯t know he¡¯d always dim, i¡¯d said bludgers permanently affected brain 


¡± ¡°ludovic bagman, caught passing infonnation lord voldemort¡¯s supporters,¡± said mr 
crouch 
¡°lor this, suggest tenn imprisonment azkaban lasting less angry outcry surrounding benches 
several witches wizards around walls stood up, shaking heads, even fists, mr 
crouch 
¡°but i¡¯ve told you, idea!¡± bagman called earnestly crowd¡¯s babble, round blue eyes widening 
¡°none all! old rookwood friend dad¡¯s

¡°it put vote,¡± said mr 
crouch coldly 
turned right-hand side dungeon 
¡°the jury please raise hands

¡± harry looked toward right-hand side dungeon 
one person raised hand 
many witches wizards around walls began clap 
one witches jury stood 
¡°yes?¡± barked crouch 
¡°we¡¯d like congratulate mr

dungeon ringing applause 
bagman got feet bowed, beaming 
¡°despicable,¡± mr 
crouch spat dumbledore, sitting bagman walked dungeon 
¡°rookwood get job indeed

total silence, broken dry sobs frail, wispy-looking witch seat next mr 
crouch 
clutching handkerchief mouth trembling hands 
harry looked crouch saw looked gaunter grayer ever 
nerve twitching temple 
¡°bring in,¡± said, voice echoed silent dungeon 
door corner opened yet 
six dementors entered time, flanking group four people 
harry saw people crowd turn look mr 
crouch 
whispered one another 
dementors placed four people four chairs chained arms stood dungeon floor 
thickset man stared blankly crouch; thinner nervous-looking man, whose eyes darting around crowd; woman thick, shining dark hair heavily hooded eyes, sitting chained chair though throne; boy late teens, looked nothing short petrified 
shivering, strawcolored hair face, freckled skin milk-white 
wispy little witch beside crouch began rock backward forward seat whimpering handkerchief 
crouch stood 
looked upon four front him, pure hatred face 
¡°you brought council magical law,¡± said clearly, ¡°so may pass judgment you, crime heinous -¡± ¡°father,¡± said boy straw-colored hair 
¡°father

¡°we heard evidence

¡°mother, stop 
mother, didn¡¯t it, wasn¡¯t me!¡± ¡°i ask jury,¡± shouted mr 
crouch, ¡°to raise hands believe, do, crimes deserve life sentence azkaban!¡± unison, witches wizards along right-hand side dungeon raised hands 
crowd around walls began clap bagman, faces full savage triumph 
boy began scream 
¡°no! mother, no! didn¡¯t it, didn¡¯t it, didn¡¯t know! don¡¯t send there, don¡¯t let him!¡± dementors gliding back room 
boys¡¯ three companions rose quietly seats; woman heavy-lidded eyes looked crouch called, ¡°the dark lord rise again, crouch! throw us azkaban; wait! rise come us, reward us beyond supporters! alone faithful! alone tried find him!¡± boy trying fight dementors, even though harry could see cold, draining power starting affect 
crowd jeering, feet, woman swept dungeon, boy continued struggle 
¡°i¡¯m son!¡± screamed crouch

crouch, eyes bulging suddenly 
¡°i son!¡± wispy witch beside gave great gasp slumped seat

crouch appeared noticed 
¡°take away!¡± crouch roared dementors, spit flying mouth 
¡°take away, may rot there!¡± ¡°father! father, wasn¡¯t involved! no! no! father, please!¡± ¡°i think harry, time return office,¡± said quiet voice harrys ear 
harry started 
looked around 
looked side 
albus dumbledore sitting right, watching crouch¡¯s son dragged away dementors - albus dumbledore left, looking right 
¡°come,¡± said dumbledore left, put hand harrys elbow 
harry felt rising air; dungeon dissolved around him; moment, blackness, felt though done slow-motion somersault, suddenly landing flat feet, seemed like dazzling light dumbledore ¡¯s sunlit office 
stone basin shimmering cabinet front him, albus dumbledore standing beside 
¡°professor,¡± harry gasped, ¡°i know shouldn¡¯t¡¯ve - 1 didn¡¯t mean - cabinet door sort open ¡°i quite understand,¡± said dumbledore 
lifted basin, carried desk, placed upon polished top, sat chair behind 
motioned harry sit opposite 
harry so, staring stone basin 
contents returned original, silvery-white state, swirling rippling beneath gaze 
¡°what it?¡± harry asked shakily 
¡°this? called pensieve,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°i sometimes find, sure know feeling, simply many thoughts memories crammed mind 
¡± ¡°er,¡± said harry, couldn¡¯t truthfully say ever felt anything sort 
¡°at times,¡± said dumbledore, indicating stone basin, ¡°i use pensieve 
one simply siphons excess thoughts one¡¯s mind, pours basin, examines one¡¯s leisure 
becomes easier spot patterns links, understand, form 
¡± ¡°you mean 


stuffs thoughts?¡± harry said, staring swirling white substance basin 
¡°certainly,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°let show 
¡± dumbledore drew wand inside robes placed tip silvery hair, near temple 
took wand away, hair seemed clinging - harry saw fact glistening strand strange silvery-white substance filled pensieve 
dumbledore added fresh thought basin, harry, astonished, saw face swimming around surface bowl 
dumbledore placed long hands either side pensieve swirled it, rather gold prospector would pan fragments gold 


harry saw face change smoothly snape¡¯s, opened mouth spoke ceiling, voice echoing slightly 
¡°it¡¯s coming back 


karkaroff 


stronger clearer ever 


¡± ¡°a connection could made without assistance,¡± dumbledore sighed, ¡°but never mind 
¡± peered top half-moon spectacles harry, gaping snape¡¯s face, continuing swirl around bowl 
¡°i using pensieve mr 
fudge arrived meeting put away rather hastily 
undoubtedly fasten cabinet door properly 
naturally, would attracted attention 
¡± ¡°i¡¯m sorry,¡± harry mumbled 
dumbledore shook head 
¡°curiosity sin,¡± said 
¡°but exercise caution curiosity 


yes, indeed 


¡± frowning slightly, prodded thoughts within basin tip wand 
instantly, figure rose it, plump, scowling girl sixteen, began revolve slowly, feet still basin 
took notice whatsoever harry professor dumbledore 
spoke, voice echoed snape¡¯s done, though coming depths stone basin 
¡°he put hex me, professor dumbledore, teasing him, sir, said i¡¯d seen kissing florence behind greenhouses last thursday 


¡± ¡°but bertha,¡± said dumbledore sadly, looking silently revolving girl, ¡°why follow first place?¡± ¡°bertha?¡± harry whispered, looking 
¡°is - bertha jorkins?¡± ¡°yes,¡± said dumbledore, prodding thoughts basin again; bertha sank back them, became silvery opaque 
¡°that bertha remember school 
¡± silvery light pensieve illuminated dumbledore¡¯s face, struck harry suddenly old looking 
knew, course, dumbledore getting years, somehow never really thought dumbledore old man 
¡°so, harry,¡± said dumbledore quietly 
¡°before got lost thoughts, wanted tell something 
¡± ¡°yes,¡± said harry 
¡°professor - 1 divination now, - er - 1 fell asleep 
¡± hesitated here, wondering reprimand coming, dumbledore merely said, ¡°quite understandable 
continue 
¡± ¡°well, dream,¡± said harry 
¡°a dream lord voldemort 
torturing wormtail 


know wormtail-¡± ¡°i know,¡± said dumbledore promptly 
¡°please continue

¡°you sirius¡¯s correspondent,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°i also contact ever since left hogwarts last year 
suggested mountainside cave safest place stay 
¡± dumbledore got began walking behind desk 
every then, placed wand tip temple, removed another shining silver thought, added pensieve 
thoughts inside began swirl fast harry couldn¡¯t make anything clearly: merely blur color 
¡°professor?¡± said quietly, couple minutes 
dumbledore stopped pacing looked harry 
¡°my apologies,¡± said quietly 
sat back desk 
¡°d¡¯you - d¡¯you know scar¡¯s hurting me?¡± dumbledore looked intently harry moment, said, ¡°i theory, 


belief scar hurts lord voldemort near you, feeling particularly strong surge hatred 
¡± ¡°but

¡°how indeed?¡± muttered dumbledore 
¡°how indeed 


¡± neither dumbledore harry spoke 
dumbledore gazing across room, and, every then, placing wand tip temple adding another shining silver thought seething mass within pensieve 
¡°professor,¡± harry said last, ¡°do think he¡¯s getting stronger?¡± ¡°voldemort?¡± said dumbledore, looking harry pensieve 
characteristic, piercing look dumbledore given occasions, always made harry feel though dumbledore seeing right way even moody¡¯s magical eye could 
¡°once harry, give suspicions 
¡± dumbledore sighed again, looked older, wearier, ever 
¡°the years voldemort¡¯s ascent power,¡± said, ¡°were marked disappearances 
bertha jorkins vanished without trace place voldemort certainly known last 
mr 
crouch disappeared 


within grounds 
third disappearance, one ministry, regret say, consider importance, concerns muggle

see, read muggle newspapers, unlike ministry friends 
¡± dumbledore looked seriously harry 
¡°these disappearances seem linked 
ministry disagrees - may heard, waiting outside office 
¡± harry nodded 
silence fell again, dumbledore extracting thoughts every 
harry felt though ought go, curiosity held chair 
¡°professor?¡± said 
¡°yes, harry?¡± said dumbledore

¡°yes, talking nevilles parents,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°his father, frank, auror like professor moody

¡°right,¡± said harry hastily, staring contents pensieve again, swirling slowly dumbledore stopped adding thoughts 
¡°and

four-point spell found going far east 
turned back, took right turn, saw odd golden mist floating ahead 
harry approached cautiously, pointing wand¡¯s beam 
looked like kind enchantment 
wondered whether might able blast way 
¡°reducio!¡± said 
spell shot straight mist, leaving intact 
supposed known better; reductor curse solid objects 
would happen walked mist? worth chancing it, double back? still hesitating scream shattered silence 
¡°fleur?¡± harry yelled

took deep breath ran enchanted mist 
world turned upside 
harry hanging ground, hair end, glasses dangling nose, threatening fall bottomless sky 
clutched end nose hung there, terrified 
felt though feet glued grass, become ceiling 
dark, star-spangled heavens stretched endlessly 
felt though tried move one feet, would fall away earth completely 
think, told himself, blood rushed head, think

dare move foot? could hear blood pounding ears 
two choices - try move, send red sparks, get rescued disqualified task 
shut eyes, wouldn¡¯t able see view endless space him, pulled right foot hard could away grassy ceiling 
immediately, world righted 
harry fell forward onto knees onto wonderfully solid ground 
felt temporarily limp shock

he¡¯d got far, hadn¡¯t he? actually managed win? fleetingly, first time since he¡¯d found champion, saw image himself, raising triwizard cup front rest school 


met nothing ten minutes, kept running dead ends 
twice took wrong turning 
finally, found new route started jog along it, wandlight waving, making shadow flicker distort hedge walls 
rounded another corner found facing blast-ended skrewt

spell hit skrewt¡¯s armor ricocheted off; harry staggered back paces fell 
¡°impedimenta!¡± skrewt inches froze - managed hit fleshy, shell-less underside 
panting, harry pushed away ran, hard, opposite direction - impediment curse permanent; skrewt would regaining use legs moment 
took left path hit dead end, right, hit another; forcing stop, heart hammering, performed four-point spell again, backtracked, chose path would take northwest 
hurrying along new path minutes, heard something path running parallel made stop dead 
¡°what doing?¡± yelled cedric¡¯s voice 
¡°what hell d¡¯you think you¡¯re doing?¡± harry heard krum¡¯s voice 
¡°crucio!¡± air suddenly full cedric¡¯s yells 
horrified, harry began sprinting path, trying find way cedric¡¯s

¡°you¡¯re on,¡± said 
¡°come 
¡± grabbed harrys ann shoulder helped harry limp toward plinth cup stood 
reached it, held hand one cup¡¯s gleaming handles 
¡°on three, right?¡± said harry 
¡°one - two - three cedric grasped handle 
instantly, harry felt jerk somewhere behind navel 
feet left ground 
could unclench hand holding triwizard cup; pulling onward howl wind swirling color, cedric side 
chapter thirty-two flesh, blood, bone harry felt feet slam ground; injured leg gave way, fell forward; hand let go triwizard cup last 
raised head 
¡°where we?¡± said 
cedric shook head 
got up, pulled harry feet, looked around 
left hogwarts grounds completely; obviously traveled miles - perhaps hundreds miles - even mountains surrounding castle gone 
standing instead dark overgrown graveyard; black outline small church visible beyond large yew tree right 
hill rose left 
harry could make outline fine old house hillside 
cedric looked triwizard cup harry 
¡°did anyone tell cup portkey?¡± asked 
¡°nope,¡± said harry 
looking around graveyard 
completely silent slightly eerie 
¡°is supposed part task?¡± ¡°i dunno,¡± said cedric 
sounded slightly nervous 
¡°wands out, d¡¯you reckon?¡± ¡°yeah,¡± said harry, glad cedric made suggestion rather 
pulled wands 
harry kept looking around 
had, yet again, strange feeling watched 
¡°someone¡¯s coming,¡± said suddenly 
squinting tensely darkness, watched figure drawing nearer, walking steadily toward graves 
harry couldn¡¯t make face, way walking holding arms, could tell carrying something 
whoever was, short, wearing hooded cloak pulled head obscure face 
- several paces nearer, gap closing time - harry saw thing persons anns looked like baby 


merely bundle robes? harry lowered wand slightly glanced sideways cedric 
cedric shot quizzical look 
turned back watch approaching figure 
stopped beside towering marble headstone, six feet 
second harry cedric short figure simply looked one another 
then, without warning, harry¡¯s scar exploded pain 
agony never felt life; wand slipped lingers put hands face; knees buckled; ground could see nothing all; head split open 
far away, head, heard high, cold voice say, ¡°kill spare 
¡± swishing noise second voice, screeched words night: ¡°avada kedavra!¡± blast green light blazed harry¡¯s eyelids, heard something heavy fall ground beside him; pain scar reached pitch retched, diminished; terrified see, opened stinging eyes 
cedric lying spread-eagled ground beside 
dead 
second contained eternity, harry stared cedric¡¯s face, open gray eyes, blank expressionless windows deserted house, half-open mouth, looked slightly surprised 
then, harry¡¯s mind accepted seeing, could feel anything numb disbelief, felt pulled feet 
short man cloak put bundle, lit wand, dragging harry toward marble headstone 
harry saw name upon flickering wandlight forced around slammed 
tom riddle cloaked man conjuring tight cords around harry, tying neck ankles headstone 
harry could hear shallow, fast breathing depths hood; struggled, man hit - hit hand finger missing 
harry realized hood 
wormtail 
¡°you!¡± gasped 
wormtail, finished conjuring ropes, reply; busy checking tightness cords, fingers trembling uncontrollably, rumbling knots 
sure harry bound tightly headstone couldn¡¯t move inch, wormtail drew length black material inside cloak stuffed roughly harry¡¯s mouth; then, without word, turned harry hurried away 
harry couldn¡¯t make sound, could see wormtail gone; couldn¡¯t turn head see beyond headstone; could see right front 
cedric¡¯s body lying twenty feet away 
way beyond him, glinting starlight, lay triwizard cup 
harry¡¯s wand ground cedric¡¯s feet 
bundle robes harry thought baby close by, foot grave 
seemed stirring fretfully 
harry watched it, scar seared pain 


suddenly knew didn¡¯t want see robes 


didn¡¯t want bundle opened 


could hear noises feet 
looked saw gigantic snake slithering grass, circling headstone tied 
wormtail¡¯s fast, wheezy breathing growing louder 
sounded though forcing something heavy across ground 
came back within harry¡¯s range vision, harry saw pushing stone cauldron foot grave 
full seemed water - harry could hear slopping around - larger cauldron harry ever used; great stone belly large enough full-grown man sit 
thing inside bundle robes ground stirring persistently, though trying free 
wormtail busying bottom cauldron wand 
suddenly crackling names beneath 
large snake slithered away darkness 
liquid cauldron seemed heat fast 
surface began bubble, send fiery sparks, though fire 
steam thickening, blurring outline wormtail tending fire 
movements beneath robes became agitated 
harry heard high, cold voice 
¡°hurry!¡± whole surface water alight sparks 
might encrusted diamonds 
¡°it ready master 
¡± ¡°now 


¡± said cold voice 
wormtail pulled open robes ground, revealing inside them, harry let yell strangled wad material blocking mouth 
though wormtail flipped stone revealed something ugly, slimy, blind - worse, hundred times worse 
thing wormtail carrying shape crouched human child, except harry never seen anything less like child 
hairless scaly-looking, dark, raw, reddish black 
arms legs thin feeble, face - child alive ever face like - flat snakelike, gleaming red eyes 
thing seemed almost helpless; raised thin arms, put around wonntail¡¯s neck, wormtail lifted 
so, hood fell back, harry saw look revulsion wormtail¡¯s weak, pale face firelight carried creature rim cauldron 
one moment, harry saw evil, flat face illuminated sparks dancing surface potion 
wonntail lowered creature cauldron; hiss, vanished surface; harry heard frail body hit bottom soft thud 
let drown, harry thought, scar burning almost past endurance, please 


let drown 


wormtail speaking 
voice shook; seemed frightened beyond wits 
raised wand, closed eyes, spoke night 
¡°bone father, unknowingly given, renew son!¡± surface grave harry¡¯s feet cracked 
horrified, harry watched fine trickle dust rose air wormtail¡¯ command fell softly cauldron 
diamond surface water broke hissed; sent sparks directions turned vivid, poisonous-looking blue 
wormtail whimpering 
pulled long, thin, shining silver dagger inside cloak 
voice broke petrified sobs 
¡°flesh - servant - w-willingly given - - revive - master 
¡± stretched right hand front - hand missing finger 
gripped dagger tightly left hand swung upward 
harry realized wormtail second happened - closed eyes tightly could, could block scream pierced night, went harry though stabbed dagger 
heard something fall ground, heard wormtail¡¯ anguished panting, sickening splash, something dropped cauldron 
harry couldn¡¯t stand look 


potion turned burning red; light shone harry¡¯s closed eyelids 


wormtail gasping moaning agony 
harry felt wormtail¡¯s anguished breath face realize wormtail right front 
¡°b-blood enemy 


forcibly taken 





resurrect foe 
¡± harry could nothing prevent it, tied tightly 


squinting down, struggling hopelessly ropes binding him, saw shining silver dagger shaking wormtails remaining hand 
felt point penetrate crook right arm blood seeping sleeve torn robes 
wormtail, still panting pain, rumbled pocket glass vial held harry¡¯s cut, dribble blood fell 
staggered back cauldron harrys blood 
poured inside 
liquid within turned, instantly, blinding white 
wormtail, job done, dropped knees beside cauldron, slumped sideways lay ground, cradling bleeding stump arm, gasping sobbing 
cauldron simmering, sending diamond sparks directions, blindingly bright turned else velvety blackness 
nothing happened 


let drowned 
harry thought, let gone wrong 


then, suddenly, sparks emanating cauldron extinguished 
surge white steam billowed thickly cauldron instead, obliterating everything front harry, couldn¡¯t see wormtail cedric anything vapor hanging air 


it¡¯s gone wrong, thought 


¡¯s drowned 


please 


please let dead 


then, mist front him, saw, icy surge terror, dark outline man, tall skeletally thin, rising slowly inside cauldron 
¡°robe me,¡± said high, cold voice behind steam, wormtail, sobbing moaning, still cradling mutilated arm, scrambled pick black robes ground, got feet, reached up, pulled onehanded master¡¯s head 
thin man stepped cauldron, staring harry 


harry stared back face haunted nightmares three years 
whiter skull, wide, livid scarlet eyes nose flat snakes slits nostrils 


lord voldemort risen 
chapter thirty-three death eaters voldemort looked away harry began examining body 
hands like large, pale spiders; long white fingers caressed chest, arms, face; red eyes, whose pupils slits, like cats, gleamed still brightly darkness 
held hands flexed fingers, expression rapt exultant 
took slightest notice wormtail, lay twitching bleeding ground, great snake, slithered back sight circling harry again, hissing 
voldemort slipped one unnaturally long-fingered hands deep pocket drew wand 
caressed gently too; raised it, pointed wormtail, lifted ground thrown headstone harry tied; fell foot lay there, crumpled crying 
voldemort turned scarlet eyes upon harry, laughing high, cold, mirthless laugh 
wormtail¡¯s robes shining blood now; wrapped stump arm 
¡°my lord 


¡± choked, ¡°my lord 


promised 


promise 


¡± ¡°hold arm,¡± said voldemort lazily 
¡°oh master 


thank you, master 


¡± extended bleeding stump, voldemort laughed 
¡°the arm, wormtail 
¡± ¡°master, please 


please 


¡± voldemort bent pulled wormtail¡¯s left ann; forced sleeve wormtail¡¯s robes past elbow, harry saw something upon skin there, something like vivid red tattoo - skull snake protruding mouth - image appeared sky quidditch world cup: dark mark 
voldemort examined carefully, ignoring wormtail¡¯s uncontrollable weeping 
¡°it back,¡± said softly, ¡°they noticed 


now, shall see 


shall know 


¡± pressed long white forefinger brand wormtail¡¯s arm 
scar harry forehead seared sharp pain again, wormtail let fresh howl; voldemort removed fingers wormtail¡¯s mark, harry saw turned jet black 
look cruel satisfaction face, voldemort straightened up, threw back head, stared around dark graveyard 
¡°how many brave enough return feel it?¡± whispered, gleaming red eyes fixed upon stars 
¡°and many foolish enough stay away?¡± began pace harry wormtail, eyes sweeping graveyard 
minute so, looked harry again, cruel smile twisting snakelike face 
¡°you stand, harry potter, upon remains late father,¡± hissed softly 
¡°a muggle fool 


like dear mother 
uses, not? mother died defend child 


killed father, see useful proved himself, death 


¡± voldemort laughed 
paced, looking around walked, snake continued circle grass 
¡°you see house upon hillside, potter? father lived

abandoned told

¡°he left returned muggle parents even bom potter, died giving birth me, leaving raised muggle orphanage 


vowed find 


revenged upon him, fool gave name 


tom riddle 


¡± still paced, red eyes darting grave grave 
¡°listen me, reliving family history 


¡± said quietly, ¡°why, growing quite sentimental 


look, harry! true family returns 


¡± air suddenly full swishing cloaks 
graves, behind yew tree, every shadowy space, wizards apparating 
hooded masked 
one one moved forward 


slowly, cautiously, though could hardly believe eyes voldemort stood silence, waiting 
one death eaters fell knees, crawled toward voldemort kissed hem black robes 
¡°master 


master¡± murmured 
death eaters behind same; approaching voldemort knees kissing robes, backing away standing up, forming silent circle, enclosed tom riddle grave, harry, voldemort, sobbing twitching heap wonntail 
yet left gaps circle, though waiting people 
voldemort, however, seem expect 
looked around hooded faces, though wind rustling seemed run around circle, though shivered 
¡°welcome, death eaters,¡± said voldemort quietly 
¡°thirteen years 


thirteen years since last met 
yet answer call though yesterday, still united dark mark, then! we?¡± put back terrible face sniffed, slit-like nostrils widening 
¡°i smell guilt,¡± said 
¡°there stench guilt upon air 
¡± second shiver ran around circle, though member longed, dare step back 
¡°i see all, whole healthy, powers intact - prompt appearances! ask 


band wizards never come aid master, swore eternal loyalty?¡± one spoke 
one moved except wormtail, upon ground, still sobbing bleeding arm 
¡°and answer myself,¡± whispered voldemort, ¡°they must believed broken, thought gone 
slipped back among enemies, pleaded innocence, ignorance, bewitchment 


¡°and ask myself, could believed would rise again? they, knew steps took, long ago, guard mortal death? they, seen proofs immensity power times mightier wizard living? ¡°and answer myself, perhaps believed still greater power could exist, one could vanquish even lord voldemort 


perhaps pay allegiance another 


perhaps champion commoners, mudbloods muggles, albus dumbledore?¡± mention dumbledore¡¯ name, members circle stirred, muttered shook heads 
voldemort ignored 
¡°it disappointment 


confess disappointed 


¡± one men suddenly flung forward, breaking circle 
trembling head foot, collapsed voldemort¡¯ feet 
¡°master!¡± shrieked, ¡°master, forgive me! forgive us all!¡± voldemort began laugh 
raised wand 
¡°crucio!¡± death eater ground writhed shrieked; harry sure sound must carry houses around 


let police come, thought desperately

voldemort raised wand 
tortured death eater lay flat upon ground, gasping 
¡°get up, avery,¡± said voldemort softly 
¡°stand 
ask forgiveness? forgive 
forget 
thirteen long years 


want thirteen years¡¯ repayment forgive 
wormtail paid debt already, not, wormtail?¡± looked wormtail, continued sob 
¡°you returned me, loyalty, fear old friends

know that, don¡¯t you?¡± ¡°yes, master,¡± moaned wormtail, ¡°please

¡± ¡°yet helped return body,¡± said voldemort coolly, watching wormtail sob ground 
¡°worthless traitorous are, helped 


lord voldemort rewards helpers 


¡± voldemort raised wand whirled air 
streak looked like molten silver hung shining wand¡¯s wake 
momentarily shapeless, writhed formed gleaming replica human hand, bright moonlight, soared downward fixed upon wormtails bleeding wrist 
wormtail¡¯s sobbing stopped abruptly 
breathing harsh ragged, raised head stared disbelief silver hand, attached seamlessly ann, though wearing dazzling glove 
flexed shining fingers, then, trembling, picked small twig ground crushed powder 
¡°my lord,¡± whispered 
¡°master

¡± scrambled forward knees kissed hem voldemort¡¯s robes 
¡°may loyalty never waver again, wormtail,¡± said voldemort 
¡°no, lord

¡± wormtail stood took place circle, staring powerful new hand, face still shining tears 
voldemort approached man wormtail¡¯s right 
¡°lucius, slippery friend,¡± whispered, halting 
¡°i told renounced old ways, though world present respectable face 
still ready take lead spot muggle -torture, believe? yet never tried find me, lucius

might energies better directed toward finding aiding master?¡± ¡°my lord, constantly alert,¡± came lucius malfoy¡¯s voice swiftly beneath hood 
¡°had sign you, whisper whereabouts, would side immediately, nothing could prevented ¡°and yet ran mark, faithful death eater sent sky last summer?¡± said voldemort lazily, mr 
malfoy stopped talking abruptly 
¡°yes, know that, lucius 


disappointed 


expect faithful service future 
¡± ¡°of course, lord, course 


merciful, thank 


¡± voldemort moved on, stopped, staring space - large enough two people - separated malfoy next man 
¡°the lestranges stand here,¡± said voldemort quietly 
¡°but entombed azkaban 
faithful 
went azkaban rather renounce 


azkaban broken open, lestranges honored beyond dreams 
dementors join us

¡± walked 
death eaters passed silence, paused others spoke 
¡°macnair

lord voldemort provide 


¡± ¡°thank you, master 


thank you,¡± murmured macnair 
¡°and here¡± - voldemort moved two largest hooded figures - ¡°we crabbe 


better time, not, crabbe? you, goyle?¡± bowed clumsily, muttering dully 
¡°yes, master 


¡± ¡°we will, master 

¡°the goes you, nott,¡± said voldemort quietly walked past stooped figure mr 
goyles shadow 
¡°my lord, prostrate you, faithful ¡°that do,¡± said voldemort 
reached largest gap all, stood surveying blank, red eyes, though could see people standing 
¡°and six missing death eaters 


three dead service 
one, cowardly return 


pay 
one, believe left forever 


killed, course 


one, remains faithful servant, already reentered service 
¡± death eaters stirred, harry saw eyes dart sideways one another masks 
¡°he hogwarts, faithful servant, efforts young friend arrived tonight 


¡°yes,¡± said voldemort, grin curling lipless mouth eyes circle flashed harry¡¯s direction 
¡°harry potter kindly joined us rebirthing party 
one might go far call guest honor 
¡± silence 
death eater right wormtail stepped forward, lucius malfoy¡¯s voice spoke mask 
¡°master, crave know 


beg tell us

miracle 


managed return us 


¡± ¡°ah, story is, lucius,¡± said voldemort 
¡°and begins - ends - young friend 
¡± walked lazily stand next harry, eyes whole circle upon two 
snake continued circle 
¡°you know, course, called boy downfall?¡± voldemort said softly, red eyes upon harry, whose scar began burn fiercely almost screamed agony 
¡°you know night lost powers body, tried kill 
mother died attempt save - unwittingly provided protection admit foreseen 


could touch boy 
¡± voldemort raised one long white fingers put close harry¡¯s cheek 
¡°his mother left upon traces sacrifice 


old magic, remembered it, foolish overlook 


matter 
touch 
¡± harry felt cold tip long white finger touch him, thought head would burst pain 
voldemort laughed softly ear, took finger away continued addressing death eaters 
¡°i miscalculated, friends, admit 
curse deflected woman¡¯s foolish sacrifice, rebounded upon 
aaah 


pain beyond pain, friends; nothing could prepared 
ripped body, less spirit, less meanest ghost 


still, alive 
was, even know 


i, gone anybody along path leads immortality 
know goal - conquer death 
now, tested, appeared one experiments worked 


killed, though curse done 
nevertheless, powerless weakest creature alive, without means help 


body, every spell might helped required use wand 


¡°i remember forcing myself, sleeplessly, endlessly, second second, exist 


settled faraway place, forest, waited 


surely, one faithful death eaters would try find 


one would come perform magic could not, restore body 


waited vain 


¡± shiver ran around circle listening death eaters 
voldemort let silence spiral horribly continuing 
¡°only one power remained 
could possess bodies others 
dared go humans plentiful, knew aurors still abroad searching 
sometimes inhabited animals - snakes, course, preference - little better inside pure spirit, bodies ill adapted perform magic 


possession shortened lives; none lasted long 


¡°then 


four years ago 


means return seemed assured 
wizard - young, foolish, gullible - wandered across path forest made home 
oh, seemed chance dreaming 


teacher dumbledore¡¯s school 


easy bend 


brought back country, while, took possession body, supervise closely carried orders 
plan failed 
manage steal sorcerer¡¯s stone 
assured immortal life 
thwarted 


thwarted, again, harry potter 


¡± silence more; nothing stirring, even leaves yew tree 
death eaters quite motionless, glittering eyes masks fixed upon voldemort, upon harry 
¡°the servant died left body, left weak ever been,¡± voldemort continued 
¡°i returned hiding place far away, pretend didn¡¯t fear might never regain powers 


yes, perhaps darkest hour 


could hope would sent another wizard possess 


given hope, now, death eaters cared become 


¡± one two masked wizards circle moved uncomfortably, voldemort took notice 
¡°and then, even year ago, almost abandoned hope, happened last 


servant returned 
wormtail here, faked death escape justice, driven hiding counted friends, decided return master 
sought country long rumored hiding 


helped, course, rats met along way 
wormtail curious affinity rats, not, wormtail? filthy little friends told place, deep albanian forest, avoided, small animals like met deaths dark shadow possessed 


¡°but journey back smooth, it, wormtail? for, hungry one night, edge forest hoped find me, foolishly stopped inn food 


meet there, one bertha jorkins, witch ministry magic 
¡°now see way fate favors lord voldemort 
might end wormtail, last hope regeneration 
wormtail - displaying presence mind would never expected - convinced bertha jorkins accompany nighttime stroll 
overpowered 


brought 
bertha jorkins, might ruined all, proved instead gift beyond wildest dreams 


- little persuasion - became veritable mine information 
¡°she told triwizard tournament would played hogwarts year 
told knew faithful death eater would willing help me, could contact 
told many things 


means used break memory charm upon powerful, extracted useful information her, mind body damaged beyond repair 
served purpose 
could possess 
disposed 
¡± voldemort smiled terrible smile, red eyes blank pitiless 
¡°wormtail¡¯ body, course, ill adapted possession, assumed dead, would attract far much attention noticed 
however, able-bodied servant needed, and, poor wizard though is, wormtail able follow instructions gave him, would return rudimentary, weak body own, body would able inhabit awaiting essential ingredients true rebirth 


spell two invention 


little help dear nagini,¡± voldemorts red eyes fell upon continually circling snake, ¡°a potion concocted unicorn blood, snake venom nagini provided 


soon returned almost human form, strong enough travel 
¡°there hope stealing sorcerer¡¯s stone anymore, knew dumbledore would seen destroyed 
willing embrace mortal life again, chasing immortality 
set sights lower 


would settle old body back again, old strength 
¡°i knew achieve - old piece dark magic, potion revived tonight - 1 would need three powerful ingredients 
well, one already hand, not, wormtail? flesh given servant 


¡°my father¡¯s bone, naturally, meant would come here, buried 
blood foe 


wormtail would use wizard, would not, wormtail? wizard hated 


many still 
knew one must use, rise again, powerful fallen 
wanted harry potters blood 
wanted blood one stripped power thirteen years ago 


lingering protection mother gave would reside veins 


¡°but get harry potter? better protected think even knows, protected ways devised dumbledore long ago, fell arrange boy¡¯s future 
dumbledore invoked ancient magic, ensure boy¡¯s protection long relations¡¯ care 
even touch 


then, course, quidditch world cup 


thought protection might weaker there, away relations dumbledore, yet strong enough attempt kidnap midst horde ministry wizards 
then, boy would return hogwarts, crooked nose muggle-loving fool morning night 
could take him? ¡°why 


using bertha jorkins¡¯s information, course 
use one faithful death eater, stationed hogwarts, ensure boy¡¯s name entered goblet fire 
use death eater ensure boy tournament - touched triwizard cup first - cup death eater turned portkey, would bring here, beyond reach dumbledore ¡¯s help protection, waiting arms 



boy believed downfall 


¡± voldemort moved slowly forward turned face harry 
raised wand 
¡°crucio!¡± pain beyond anything harry ever experienced; bones fire; head surely splitting along scar; eyes rolling madly head; wanted end 


black 


die 


gone 
hanging limply ropes binding headstone voldemort¡¯s father, looking bright red eyes kind mist 
night ringing sound death eaters¡¯ laughter 
¡°you see, think, foolish suppose boy could ever stronger me,¡± said voldemort 
¡°but want mistake anybody¡¯s mind 
harry potter escaped lucky chance 
going prove power killing him, now, front all, dumbledore help him, mother die 
give chance 
allowed fight, left doubt us stronger 
little longer, nagini,¡± whispered, snake glided away grass death eaters stood watching 
¡°now untie him, wormtail, give back wand 
¡± chapter thirty-four prior incantatem wormtail approached harry, scrambled find feet, support weight ropes untied 
wormtail raised new silver hand, pulled wad material gagging harry, then, one swipe, cut bonds tying harry gravestone 
split second, perhaps, harry might considered running it, injured leg shook stood overgrown grave, death eaters closed ranks, fonning tighter circle around voldemort, gaps missing death eaters stood filled 
wormtail walked circle place cedric¡¯s body lay returned harry¡¯s wand, thrust roughly harry¡¯s hand without looking 
wormtail resumed place circle watching death eaters 
¡°you taught duel harry potter?¡± said voldemort softly, red eyes glinting darkness 
words harry remembered, though former life, dueling club hogwarts attended briefly two years ago 


learned disanning spell, ¡°expelliarmus¡± 


use would deprive voldemort wand, even could, surrounded death eaters, outnumbered least thirty one? never learned anything could possibly fit 
knew facing thing moody always warned 


unblockable avada kedavra curse - voldemort right - mother die time 


quite unprotected 


¡°we bow 
harry,¡± said voldemort, bending little, keeping snakelike face upturned harry 
¡°come, niceties must observed 


dumbledore would like show manners 


bow death, harry 


¡± death eaters laughing 
voldemorts lipless mouth smiling 
harry bow 
going let voldemort play killing 


going give satisfaction 


¡°i said, bow,¡± voldemort said, raising wand - harry felt spine curve though huge, invisible hand bending ruthlessly forward, death eaters laughed harder ever 
¡°very good,¡± said voldemort softly, raised wand pressure bearing upon harry lifted 
¡°and face me, like man 


straight-backed proud, way father died 


¡°and - duel 
¡± voldemort raised wand, harry could anything defend himself, could even move, hit cruciatus curse 
pain intense, all- consuming, longer knew 


white-hot knives piercing every inch skin, head surely going burst pain, screaming loudly he¡¯d ever screamed life - stopped 
harry rolled scrambled feet; shaking uncontrollably wormtail done hand cut off; staggered sideways wall watching death eaters, pushed away, back toward voldemort 
¡°a little break,¡± said voldemort, slit-like nostrils dilating excitement, ¡°a little pause 


hurt, didn¡¯t harry? don¡¯t want again, you?¡± harry didn¡¯t answer 
going die like cedric, pitiless red eyes telling 


going die, nothing could 


wasn¡¯t going play along 
wasn¡¯t going obey voldemort 


wasn¡¯t going beg 


¡°i asked whether want again,¡± said voldemort softly 
¡°answer me! imperio¡± harry felt, third time life, sensation mind wiped thought 


ah, bliss, think, though floating, dreaming 


answer 


say 


answer 


not, said stronger voice, back head, won¡¯t answer 


answer 


won¡¯t it, won¡¯t say 


answer 


¡°i won¡¯t!¡± words burst harry¡¯s mouth; echoed graveyard, dream state lifted suddenly though cold water thrown - back rushed aches cruciatus curse left body - back rushed realization was, facing 


¡°you won¡¯t?¡± said voldemort quietly, death eaters laughing 
¡°you won¡¯t say no? harry, obedience virtue need teach die 


perhaps another little dose pain?¡± voldemort raised wand, time harry ready; reflexes bom quidditch training, flung sideways onto ground; rolled behind marble headstone voldemort father, heard crack curse missed 
¡°we playing hide-and-seek, harry,¡± said voldemort¡¯s soft, cold voice, drawing nearer, death eaters laughed 
¡°you cannot hide 
mean tired duel? mean would prefer finish now, harry? come out, harry 


come play, 


quick 


might even painless 


would know 


never died 


¡± harry crouched behind headstone knew end come 
hope 


help 
heard voldemort draw nearer still, knew one thing only, beyond fear reason: going die crouching like child playing hide-and- seek; going die kneeling voldemort feet 


going die upright like father, going die trying defend himself, even defense possible 


voldemort could stick snakelike face around headstone 
harry stood 


gripped wand tightly hand, thrust front him, threw around headstone, facing voldemort 
voldemort ready 
harry shouted, ¡°expelliarmus!¡± voldemort cried, ¡°avada kedavra!¡± jet green light issued voldemorts wand jet red light blasted harry¡¯s - met midair - suddenly harry¡¯s wand vibrating though electric charge surging it; hand seized around it; couldn¡¯t released he¡¯d wanted - narrow beam light connected two wands, neither red green, bright, deep gold 
harry, following beam astonished gaze, saw voldemort¡¯s long white fingers gripping wand shaking vibrating 
- nothing could prepared harry - felt feet lift ground 
voldemort raised air, wands still connected thread shimmering golden light 
glided away tombstone voldemort¡¯s father came rest patch ground clear free graves 


death eaters shouting; asking voldemort instructions; closing in, refonning circle around harry voldemort, snake slithering heels, drawing wands - golden thread connecting harry voldemort splintered; though wands remained connected, thousand beams arced high harry voldemort, crisscrossing around them, enclosed golden, dome-shaped web, cage light, beyond death eaters circled like jackals, cries strangely muffled 


¡°do nothing!¡± voldemort shrieked death eaters, harry saw red eyes wide astonishment happening, saw fighting break thread light still connecting wand harry¡¯s; harry held onto wand tightly, hands, golden thread remained unbroken 
¡°do nothing unless command you!¡± voldemort shouted death eaters 
unearthly beautiful sound filled air 


coming every thread light-spun web vibrating around harry voldemort 
sound harry recognized, though heard life: phoenix song 
sound hope harry 


beautiful welcome thing ever heard life 


felt though song inside instead around 


sound connected dumbledore, almost though friend speaking ear 


¡¯t break connection 
know 
harry told music, know ¡¯t 


sooner thought it, thing became much harder 
wand began vibrate powerfully ever 


beam voldemort changed 


though large beads light sliding thread connecting wands - harry felt wand give shudder hand light beads began slide slowly steadily way 


direction beams movement toward him, voldemort, felt wand shudder angrily 


closest bead light moved nearer harrys wand tip, wood beneath fingers grew hot feared would burst flame 
closer bead moved, harder harry¡¯s wand vibrated; sure wand would survive contact it; felt though shatter fingers - concentrated every last particle mind upon forcing bead back toward voldemort, ears full phoenix song, eyes furious, fixed 


slowly, slowly, beads quivered halt, then, slowly, began move way 


voldemort¡¯s wand vibrating extra-hard 


voldemort looked astonished, almost fearful 


one beads light quivering, inches tip voldemorts wand 
harry didn¡¯t understand it, didn¡¯t know might achieve 


concentrated never done life forcing bead light right back voldemort wand 


slowly 


slowly 


moved along golden thread 


trembled moment 


connected 


once, voldemorts wand began emit echoing screams pain 


- voldemort¡¯s red eyes widened shock - dense, smoky hand flew tip vanished 


ghost hand made wormtail 


shouts pain 


something much larger began blossom voldemorts wand tip, great, grayish something, looked though made solidest, densest smoke

¡°a old family - donations excellent causes ¡°macnair!¡± harry continued 
¡°also cleared! working ministry!¡± ¡°avery - nott - crabbe - goyle ¡°you merely repeating names acquitted death eaters thirteen years ago!¡± said fudge angrily

point worrying yet, told himself, got back dursleys¡¯ car 
hagrid said, would come, would come 


would meet 

chapter one dudley demented hottest day summer far drawing close drowsy silence lay large, square houses privet drive 
cars usually gleaming stood dusty drives lawns emerald green lay parched yellowing; use hosepipes banned due drought 
deprived usual car-washing lawn-mowing pursuits, inhabitants privet drive retreated shade cool houses, windows thrown wide hope tempting nonexistent breeze 
person left outdoors teenage boy lying flat back flowerbed outside number four 
skinny, black-haired, bespectacled boy pinched, slightly unhealthy look someone grown lot short space time 
jeans tom dirty, t-shirt baggy faded, soles trainers peeling away uppers 
harry potter¡¯s appearance endear neighbors, sort people thought scruffiness ought punishable law, hidden behind large hydrangea bush evening quite invisible passers-by 
fact, way would spotted uncle vernon aunt petunia stuck heads living-room window looked straight flowerbed 
whole, harry thought congratulated idea hiding 
not, perhaps, comfortable lying hot, hard earth but, hand, nobody glaring him, grinding teeth loudly could hear news, shooting nasty questions him, happened every time tried sitting living room watch television aunt uncle 
almost though thought fluttered open window, vernon dursley, harry¡¯s uncle, suddenly spoke 
¡°glad see boy¡¯s stopped trying butt 
he, anyway?¡± ¡°i don¡¯t know,¡± said aunt petunia, unconcerned 
¡°not house 
¡± uncle vernon grunted 
¡°watching news

¡°the window¡¯s open!¡± ¡°oh - yes - sorry, dear 
¡± dursleys fell silent 
harry listened jingle fruit ¡®n¡¯ bran breakfast cereal watched mrs

frowning muttering 
harry pleased concealed behind bush, mrs

¡°dudders tea?¡± ¡°at polkisses¡¯,¡± said aunt petunia fondly 
¡°he¡¯s got many little friends, he¡¯s popular 
¡± harry suppressed snort difficulty 
dursleys really astonishingly stupid son, dudley 
swallowed dim-witted lies tea different member gang every night summer holidays 
harry knew perfectly well dudley tea anywhere; gang spent every evening vandalizing play park, smoking street corners throwing stones passing cars children 
harry seen evening walks around little whinging; spent holidays wandering streets, scavenging newspapers bins along way 
opening notes music heralded seven o¡¯clock news reached harry¡¯s ears stomach turned 
perhaps tonight - month waiting - would night 
"record numbers stranded holiday makers fill air ports spanish baggage-handlers¡¯¡¯ strike reaches second week - ¡± ¡°give ¡®em lifelong siesta, would,¡± snarled uncle vernon end newsreader¡¯s sentence, matter: outside flowerbed, harry¡¯s stomach seemed unclench 
anything happened, would surely first item news; death destruction important stranded holidaymakers 
let long, slow breath stared brilliant blue sky 
every day summer same: tension, expectation, temporary relief, mounting tension 


always, growing insistent time, question nothing happened yet 
kept listening, case small clue, recognized really muggles - unexplained disappearance, perhaps, strange accident 


baggage-handlers¡¯ strike followed news drought southeast (¡°i hope he¡¯s listening next door!¡± bellowed uncle vernon 
¡°him sprinklers three morning!¡±), helicopter almost crashed field surrey, famous actress¡¯s divorce famous husband (¡°as we¡¯re interested sordid affairs,¡± sniffed aunt petunia, followed case obsessively every magazine could lay bony hands on) 
harry closed eyes blazing evening sky newsreader said, ¡°-and finally, bungy budgie found novel way keeping cool summer 
bungy, lives five feathers barnsley, learned water ski! maty dorkins went find 
¡± harry opened eyes 
reached water-skiing budgerigars, would nothing else worth hearing 
rolled cautiously front raised knees elbows, preparing crawl window 
moved two inches several things happened quick succession 
loud, echoing crack broke sleepy silence like gunshot; cat streaked parked car flew sight; shriek, bellowed oath sound breaking china came dursleys¡¯ living room, though signal harry waiting jumped feet, time pulling waistband jeans thin wooden wand unsheathing sword - could draw full height, top head collided dursleys¡¯ open window 
resultant crash made aunt petunia scream even louder 
harry felt though head split two 
eyes streaming, swayed, trying focus street spot source noise, barely staggered upright two large purple hands reached open window closed tightly around throat 
¡°put - it-away!¡± uncle vernon snarled harry¡¯s ear 
¡°now! before- anyone - sees!¡± ¡°get - - me!¡± harry gasped 
seconds struggled, harry pulling uncles sausage-like fingers left hand, right maintaining firm grip raised wand; then, pain top harry¡¯s head gave particularly nasty throb, uncle vernon yelped released harry though received electric shock 
invisible force seemed surged nephew, making impossible hold 
panting, harry fell forwards hydrangea bush, straightened stared around 
sign caused loud cracking noise, several faces peering various nearby windows 
harry stuffed wand hastily back jeans tried look innocent 
¡°lovely evening!¡± shouted uncle vernon, waving mrs 
number seven, glaring behind net curtains 
¡°did hear car backfire now? gave petunia quite turn!¡± continued grin horrible, manic way curious neighbors disappeared various windows, grin became grimace rage beckoned harry back towards 
harry moved steps closer, taking care stop short point uncle vernon¡¯s outstretched hands could resume strangling 
¡°what devil mean it, boy?¡± asked uncle vernon croaky voice trembled fury 
¡°what mean what?¡± said harry coldly 
kept looking left right street, still hoping see person made cracking noise 
¡°making racket like starting pistol right outside ¡ª ¡± ¡°i didn¡¯t make noise,¡± said harry firmly 
aunt petunia¡¯s thin, horsy face appeared beside uncle vernon¡¯s wide, purple one 
looked livid 
¡°why lurking window?¡± ¡°yes - yes, good point, petunia! window, boy?¡± ¡°listening news,¡± said harry resigned voice 
aunt uncle exchanged looks outrage 
¡°listening news! again?¡± ¡°well, changes every day, see,¡± said harry 
¡°don¡¯t clever me, boy! want know you¡¯re really - don¡¯t give listening news tosh! know perfectly well lot ¡°careful, vernon!¡± breathed aunt petunia, uncle vernon lowered voice harry could barely hear him, ¡°-that lot don¡¯t get news!¡± ¡°that¡¯s know,¡± said harry 
dursleys goggled seconds, aunt petunia said, ¡°you¡¯re nasty little liar 
she, too, lowered voice harry lip-read next word, ¡°- owls they¡¯re bringing news?¡± ¡°aha!¡± said uncle vernon triumphant whisper 
¡°get one, boy! didn¡¯t know get news pestilential birds!¡± harry hesitated moment 
cost something tell truth time, even though aunt uncle could possibly know bad felt admitting 
¡°the owls 


aren¡¯t bringing news,¡± said tonelessly 
¡°i don¡¯t believe it,¡± said aunt petunia 
¡°no i,¡± said uncle vernon forcefully 
¡°we know you¡¯re something funny,¡± said aunt petunia 
¡°we¡¯re stupid, know,¡± said uncle vernon 
¡°well, that¡¯s news me,¡± said harry, temper rising, dursleys could call back, wheeled about, crossed front lawn, stepped low garden wall striding street 
trouble knew 
would face aunt uncle later pay price rudeness, care much moment; much pressing matters mind 
harry sure cracking noise made someone apparating disapparating 
exactly sound dobby house-elf made vanished thin air 
possible dobby privet drive? could dobby following right moment? thought occurred wheeled around stared back privet drive, appeared completely deserted harry sure dobby know become invisible 
walked on, hardly aware route taking, pounded streets often lately feet carried favorite haunts automatically 
every steps glanced back shoulder 
someone magical near lay among aunt petunia¡¯s dying begonias, sure 
hadn¡¯t spoken him, hadn¡¯t made contact, hiding now? then, feeling frustration peaked, certainty leaked away 
perhaps hadn¡¯t magical sound 
perhaps desperate tiniest sign contact world belonged simply overreacting perfectly ordinary noises 
could sure hadn¡¯t sound something breaking inside neighbor¡¯s house? harry felt dull, sinking sensation stomach knew feeling hopelessness plagued summer rolled 
tomorrow morning would woken alarm five o¡¯clock could pay owl delivered daily prophet - point continuing take it? harry merely glanced front page throwing aside days; idiots ran paper finally realized voldemort back would headline news, kind harry cared 
lucky, would also owls carrying letters best friends ron hennione, though expectation he¡¯d letters would bring news long since dashed 
can't say much you-know-what, obviously 


we've told say anything important case letters go astray 


we're quite busy can' give details 


there's fair amount going on, we'll tell everything see 


going see him? nobody seemed bothered precise date 
hermione scribbled expect we¡¯ll seeing quite soon inside birthday card, soon soon? far harry could tell vague hints letters, hermione ron place, presumably ron¡¯s parents¡¯ house 
could hardly bear think pair fun burrow stuck privet drive 
fact, angry thrown away, unopened, two boxes honey dukes chocolates they¡¯d sent birthday 
he¡¯d regretted later, wilted salad aunt petunia provided dinner night 
ron hennione busy with? wasn¡¯t he, harry, busy? hadn¡¯t proved capable handling much them? forgotten done? hadn¡¯t entered graveyard watched cedric murdered, tied tombstone nearly killed? think that, harry told sternly hundredth time summer 
bad enough kept revisiting graveyard nightmares, without dwelling waking moments 
turned corner magnolia crescent; halfway along passed narrow alleyway side garage first clapped eyes godfather 
sirius, least, seemed understand harry feeling 
admittedly, letters empty proper news ron hermione¡¯s, least contained words caution consolation instead tantalizing hints: know must frustrating 


keep nose clean everything okay 


careful anything rash 


well, thought harry, crossed magnolia crescent, turned magnolia road headed towards darkening play park, (by large) done sirius advised 
least resisted temptation tie trunk broomstick set burrow 
fact, harry thought behavior good considering frustrated angry felt stuck privet drive long, reduced hiding flowerbeds hope hearing something might point lord voldemort 
nevertheless, quite galling told rash man served twelve years wizard prison, azkaban, escaped, attempted commit murder convicted first place, gone run stolen hippogriff 
harry vaulted locked park gate set across parched grass 
park empty surrounding streets 
reached swings sank one dudley friends yet managed break, coiled one arm around chain stared moodily ground 
would able hide dursleys¡¯ flowerbed 
tomorrow, would think fresh way listening news 
meantime, nothing look forward another restless, disturbed night, even escaped nightmares cedric unsettling dreams long dark corridors, finishing dead ends locked doors, supposed something trapped feeling awake 
often old scar forehead prickled uncomfortably, fool ron hermione sirius would find interesting 
past, scar hurting warned voldemort getting stronger again, voldemort back would probably remind regular irritation expected 


nothing worry 


old news 


injustice welled inside wanted yell fury 
hadn¡¯t him, nobody would even known voldemort back! reward stuck little whinging four solid weeks, completely cut magical world, reduced squatting among dying begonias could hear water-skiing budgerigars! could dumbledore forgotten easily? ron hermione got together without inviting along, too? much longer supposed endure sirius telling sit tight good boy; resist temptation write stupid daily prophet point voldemort returned? furious thoughts whirled around harry¡¯s head, insides writhed anger sultry, velvety night fell around him, air full smell warm, dry grass, sound low grumble traffic road beyond park railings 
know long sat swing sound voices interrupted musings looked 
streetlamps surrounding roads casting misty glow strong enough silhouette group people making way across park 
one singing loud, crude song 
others laughing 
soft ticking noise came several expensive racing bikes wheeling along 
harry knew people

dudley vast ever, year¡¯s hard dieting discovery new talent wrought quite change physique 
uncle vernon delightedly told anyone would listen, dudley recently become junior heavyweight inter-school boxing champion southeast 
¡®the noble sport¡¯, uncle vernon called it, made dudley even formidable seemed harry primary school days served dudley¡¯s first punching bag 
harry remotely afraid cousin still didn¡¯t think dudley learning punch harder accurately cause celebration 
neighborhood children around terrified - even terrified ¡®that potter boy¡¯ who, warned, hardened hooligan attended st 
brutus¡¯s secure center incurably criminal boys 
harry watched dark figures crossing grass wondered beating tonight 
look round, harry found thinking watched

harry copied words three separate pieces parchment moment reached desk dark bedroom 
addressed first sirius, second ron third hennione 
owl, hedwig, hunting; cage stood empty desk 
harry paced bedroom waiting come back, head pounding, brain busy sleep even though eyes stung itched tiredness 
back ached hauling dudley home, two lumps head window dudley hit throbbing painfully 
paced, consumed anger frustration, grinding teeth clenching fists, casting angry looks empty, star-strewn sky every time passed window 
dementors sent get him, mrs 
figg mundungus fletcher tailing secret, suspension hogwarts hearing ministry magic - still one telling going 
what, what, howler about? whose voice echoed horribly, menacingly, kitchen? still trapped without information? everyone treating like naughty kid? don¡¯t magic, stay house 


kicked school trunk passed it, far relieving anger felt worse, sharp pain toe deal addition pain rest body 
limped past window, hedwig soared soft rustle wings like small ghost 
¡°about time!¡± harry snarled, landed lightly top cage 
¡°you put down, i¡¯ve got work you!¡± hedwig¡¯s large, round, amber eyes gazed reproachfully dead frog clamped beak 
¡°come here,¡± said harry, picking three small rolls parchment leather thong tying scrolls scaly leg 
¡°take straight sirius, ron hennione don¡¯t come back without good long replies 
keep pecking till they¡¯ve written decent-length answers you¡¯ve got

bound write back quickly; couldn¡¯t possibly ignore dementor attack 
he¡¯d probably wake tomorrow three fat letters full sympathy plans immediate removal burrow 
comforting idea, sleep rolled him, stifling thought 
hedwig didn¡¯t return next morning 
harry spent day bedroom, leaving go bathroom 
three times day aunt petunia shoved food room cat flap uncle vernon installed three summers ago 
every time harry heard approaching tried question howler, might well interrogated doorknob answers got 
otherwise, dursleys kept well clear bedroom 
harry couldn¡¯t see point forcing company them; another row would achieve nothing except perhaps make angry he¡¯d perform illegal magic 
went three whole days 
harry alternately filled restless energy made unable settle anything, time paced bedroom, furious whole lot leaving stew mess; lethargy complete could bed hour time, staring dazedly space, aching dread thought ministry hearing 
ruled him? expelled wand snapped half? would do, would go? could return living full-time dursleys, knew world, one really belonged 
might able move sirius¡¯s house, sirius suggested year ago, forced flee ministry? would harry allowed live alone, given still underage? would matter went next decided him? breach international statute secrecy severe enough land cell azkaban? whenever thought occurred, harry invariably slid bed began pacing 
fourth night hedwig¡¯s departure harry lying one apathetic phases, staring ceiling, exhausted mind quite blank, uncle entered bedroom 
harry looked slowly around 
uncle vernon wearing best suit expression enonnous smugness 
¡°we¡¯re going out,¡± said

¡± uncle vernon glared harry, clearly suspicious lack argument, stomped room closed door behind 
harry heard key turn lock uncle vernon¡¯s footsteps walking heavily stairs 
minutes later heard slamming car doors, rumble engine, unmistakable sound car sweeping drive 
harry particular feeling dursleys leaving 
made difference whether house 
could even summon energy get turn bedroom light 
room grew steadily darker around lay listening night sounds window kept open time, waiting blessed moment hedwig returned 
empty house creaked around 
pipes gurgled 
harry lay kind stupor, thinking nothing, suspended misery 
then, quite distinctly, heard crash kitchen 
sat bolt upright, listening intently 
dursleys couldn¡¯t back, much soon, case hadn¡¯t heard car 
silence seconds, voices 
burglars, thought, sliding bed feet - split second later occurred burglars would keep voices down, whoever moving around kitchen certainly troubling 
snatched wand bedside table stood facing bedroom door, listening might 
next moment, jumped lock gave loud click door swung open 
harry stood motionless, staring open doorway dark upstairs landing, straining ears sounds, none came 
hesitated moment, moved swiftly silently room head stairs 
heart shot upwards throat 
people standing shadowy hall below, silhouetted streetlight glowing glass door; eight nine them, all, far could see, looking 
¡°lower wand, boy, take someone¡¯s eye out,¡± said low, growling voice

¡°i don¡¯t know much ¡®professor¡¯,¡± growled voice, ¡°never got round much teaching, i? get here, want see properly 
¡± harry lowered wand slightly relax grip it, move 
good reason suspicious 
recently spent nine months thought mad-eye moody¡¯s company find wasn¡¯t moody all, impostor; impostor, moreover, tried kill harry unmasked 
could make decision next, second, slightly hoarse voice floated upstairs 
¡°it¡¯s right, harry 
we¡¯ve come take away 
¡± harry¡¯s heart leapt 
knew voice, too, though hadn¡¯t heard year 
¡°p-professor lupin?¡± said disbelievingly 
¡°is you?¡± ¡°why standing dark?¡± said third voice, one completely unfamiliar, woman¡¯s 
¡°lumos 
¡± wand-tip flared, illuminating hall magical light 
harry blinked 
people crowded around foot stairs, gazing intently, craning heads better look 
remus lupin stood nearest 
though still quite young, lupin looked tired rather ill; grey hairs harry last said goodbye robes patched shabbier ever 
nevertheless, smiling broadly harry, tried smile back despite state shock 
¡°oooh, looks like thought would,¡± said witch holding lit wand aloft 
looked youngest there; pale heart-shaped face, dark twinkling eyes, short spiky hair violent shade violet 
¡°wotcher, harry!¡± ¡°yeah, see mean, remus,¡± said bald black wizard standing furthest back - deep, slow voice wore single gold hoop ear - ¡°he looks exactly like james

unless anyone brought veritaserum?¡± ¡°harry, form patronus take?¡± lupin asked 
¡°a stag,¡± said harry nervously 
¡°that¡¯s him, mad-eye,¡± said lupin 
conscious everybody still staring him, harry descended stairs, stowing wand back pocket jeans came 
¡°don¡¯t put wand there, boy!¡± roared moody 
¡°what ignited? better wizards lost buttocks, know!¡± ¡°who d¡¯you know who¡¯s lost buttock?¡± violet-haired woman asked mad-eye interestedly 
¡°never mind, keep wand back pocket!¡± growled mad-eye 
¡°elementary wand-safety, nobody bothers 
¡± stumped towards kitchen 
¡°and saw that,¡± added irritably, woman rolled eyes towards ceiling 
lupin held hand shook harry¡¯s 
¡°how you?¡± asked, looking closely harry 
¡°f-fine 


¡± harry could hardly believe real 
four weeks nothing, tiniest hint plan remove privet drive, suddenly whole bunch wizards standing matter-of factly house though long-standing arrangement 
glanced people surrounding lupin; still gazing avidly 
felt conscious fact combed hair four days 
¡°i¡¯m - you¡¯re really lucky dursleys

¡± ¡°where going? burrow?¡± harry asked hopefully 
¡°not burrow, no,¡± said lupin, motioning harry towards kitchen; little knot wizards followed, still eyeing harry curiously 
¡°too risky 
we¡¯ve set headquarters somewhere undetectable

¡± mad-eye moody sitting kitchen table swigging hip flask, magical eye spinning directions, taking dursleys¡¯ many labor-saving appliances

¡°we¡¯re discussing anything here, it¡¯s risky,¡± said moody, turning normal eye harry 
magical eye remained focused ceiling 
¡°damn it,¡± added angrily, putting hand magical eye, ¡°it keeps getting stuck - ever since scum wore

¡°here go!¡± called tonks, seconds later landed 
harry touched right behind dismounted patch unkempt grass middle small square 
tonks already unbuckling harry¡¯s trunk 
shivering, harry looked around 
grimy fronts surrounding houses welcoming; broken windows, glimmering dully light fro streetlamps, paint peeling many doors heaps rubbish lay outside several sets front steps 
¡°where we?¡± harry asked, lupin said quietly, ¡°in minute 
¡± moody rummaging cloak, gnarled hands clumsy cold

expression normally kind face looked dangerous 
¡°you haven¡¯t forgotten dumbledore said, suppose?¡± ¡°which bit?¡± sirius asked politely, air man readying fight 
¡°the bit telling harry needs know,¡± said mrs 
weasley, placing heavy emphasis last three words 
ron, hermione, fred george¡¯s heads swiveled sirius mrs

blacks ear-splitting shrieks added din 
lupin hurried portrait restore calm 
returned, closing kitchen door behind taking seat table again, sirius spoke 
¡°okay, harry 


want know?¡± harry took deep breath asked question obsessed last month 
¡°where¡¯s voldemort?¡± said, ignoring renewed shudders winces name 
¡°what¡¯s doing? i¡¯ve trying watch muggle news, hasn¡¯t anything looks like yet, funny deaths anything 
¡± ¡°that¡¯s haven¡¯t funny deaths yet,¡± said sirius, ¡°not far know, anyway 


know quite lot 
¡± ¡°more thinks do, anyway,¡± said lupin 
¡°how come he¡¯s stopped killing people?¡± harry asked 
knew voldemort murdered last year alone 
¡°because doesn¡¯t want draw attention himself,¡± said sirius 
¡°it would dangerous 
comeback didn¡¯t come quite way wanted to, see 
messed 
¡± ¡°or rather, messed him,¡± said lupin, satisfied smile 
¡°how?¡± harry asked, perplexed 
¡°you weren¡¯t supposed survive!¡± said sirius 
¡°nobody apart death eaters supposed know he¡¯d come back 
survived bear witness 
¡± ¡°and last person wanted alerted return moment got back dumbledore,¡± said lupin 
¡°and made sure dumbledore knew 
¡± ¡°how helped?¡± harry asked 
¡°are kidding?¡± said bill incredulously 
¡°dumbledore one you-know-who ever scared of!¡± ¡°thanks you, dumbledore able recall order phoenix hour voldemort returned,¡± said sirius 
¡°so, what¡¯s order doing?¡± said harry, looking around 
¡°working hard make sure voldemort can¡¯t carry plans,¡± said sirius 
¡°how d¡¯you know plans are?¡± harry asked quickly 
¡°dumbledore ¡¯s got shrewd idea,¡¯ said lupin, ¡°and dumbledore ¡¯s shrewd ideas normally turn accurate 
¡± ¡°so dumbledore reckon he¡¯s planning?¡± ¡°well, firstly, wants build anny again,¡± said sirius 
¡°in old days huge numbers command: witches wizards he¡¯d bullied bewitched following him, faithful death eaters, great variety dark creatures 
heard planning recruit giants; well, they¡¯ll one groups he¡¯s 
he¡¯s certainly going try take ministry magic dozen death eaters 
¡± ¡°so you¡¯re trying stop getting followers?¡± ¡°we¡¯re best,¡± said lupin 
¡°how?¡± ¡°well, main thing try convince many people possible you-know-who really returned, put guard,¡± said bill 
¡°it¡¯s proving tricky, though 
¡± ¡°why?¡± ¡°because ministry¡¯s attitude,¡± said tonks 
¡°you saw cornelius fudge you-know- came back, harry 
well, hasn¡¯t shifted position 
he¡¯s absolutely refusing believe it¡¯s happened 
¡± ¡°but why?¡± said harry desperately 
¡°why¡¯s stupid? dumbledore -¡± ¡°ah, well, you¡¯ve put finger problem,¡± said mr 
weasley wry smile 
¡°dumbledore 
¡± ¡°fudge frightened him, see,¡± said tonks sadly 
¡°frightened dumbledore?¡± said harry incredulously 
¡°frightened he¡¯s to,¡± said mr 
weasley 
¡°fudge thinks dumbledore¡¯s plotting overthrow 
thi nk dumbledore wants minister magic 
¡± ¡°but dumbledore doesn¡¯t want -¡± ¡°of course doesn¡¯t,¡± said mr 
weasley 
¡°he¡¯s never wanted minister¡¯s job, even though lot people wanted take millicent bagnold retired 
fudge came power instead, he¡¯s never quite forgotten much popular support dumbledore had, even though dumbledore never applied job 
¡± ¡°deep down, fudge knows dumbledore¡¯s much cleverer - much powerful wizard, early days ministry forever asking dumbledore help advice,¡± said lupin 
¡°but seems he¡¯s become fond power, much confident 
loves minister magic he¡¯s managed convince he¡¯s clever one dumbledore¡¯s simply stirring trouble sake 
¡± ¡°how think that?¡± said harry angrily 
¡°how think dumbledore would make - i¡¯d make up?¡± ¡°because accepting voldemort¡¯s back would mean trouble like ministry hasn¡¯t cope nearly fourteen years,¡± said sirius bitterly 
¡°fudge can¡¯t bring face 
it¡¯s much comfortable convince dumbledore¡¯s lying destabilize 
¡± ¡°you see problem,¡± said lupin 
¡°while ministry insists nothing fear voldemort it¡¯s hard convince people he¡¯s back, especially really don¡¯t want believe first place 
what¡¯s more, ministry¡¯s leaning heavily daily prophet report they¡¯re calling dumbledore¡¯s rumor-mongering, wizarding community completely unaware things happened, makes easy targets death eaters they¡¯re using imperius curse 
¡± ¡°but you¡¯re telling people, aren¡¯t you?¡± said harry, looking around mr 
weasley, sirius, bill, mundungus, lupin tonks 
¡°you¡¯re letting people know he¡¯s back?¡± smiled humorlessly 
¡°well, everyone thinks i¡¯m mad mass-murderer ministry¡¯s put ten thousand galleon price head, hardly stroll street start handing leaflets, i?¡± said sirius restlessly 
¡°and i¡¯m popular dinner guest community,¡± said lupin 
¡°it¡¯s occupational hazard werewolf 
¡± ¡°tonks arthur would lose jobs ministry started shooting mouths off,¡± said sirius, ¡°and it¡¯s important us spies inside ministry, bet voldemort 
¡± ¡°we¡¯ve managed convince couple people, though,¡± said mr 
weasley, ¡°tonks here, one - she¡¯s young order phoenix last time, aurors side huge advantage - kingsley shacklebolt¡¯s real asset, too; he¡¯s charge hunt sirius, he¡¯s feeding ministry infonnation sirius tibet 
¡± ¡°but none putting news voldemorts back harry began 
¡°who said none us putting news out?¡± said sirius 
¡°why d¡¯you think dumbledore¡¯s trouble?¡± ¡°what d¡¯you mean?¡± harry asked 
¡°they¡¯re trying discredit him,¡± said lupin 
¡°didn¡¯t see daily prophet last week? reported he¡¯d voted chairmanship international confederation wizards he¡¯s getting old losing grip, it¡¯s true; voted ministry wizards made speech announcing voldemorts return 
they¡¯ve demoted chief warlock wizengamot - that¡¯s wizard high court - they¡¯re talking taking away order merlin, first class, 
¡± ¡°but dumbledore says doesn¡¯t care long don¡¯t take chocolate frog cards,¡± said bill, grinning 
¡°it¡¯s laughing matter,¡± said mr 
weasley sharply 
¡°if carries defying ministry like could end azkaban, last thing want dumbledore locked 
you-know-who knows dumbledore ¡¯s wise he¡¯s he¡¯s going go cautiously 
dumbledore ¡¯s way - well, you-know-who clear field 
¡± ¡°but voldemort¡¯s trying recruit death eaters it¡¯s bound get he¡¯s come back, isn¡¯t it?¡± asked harry desperately 
¡°voldemort doesn¡¯t march people¡¯s houses bang front doors, harry,¡± said sirius 
¡°he tricks, jinxes blackmails 
he¡¯s well-practiced operating secret 
case, gathering followers one thing he¡¯s interested 
he¡¯s got plans too, plans put operation quietly indeed, he¡¯s concentrating moment 
¡¯ ¡°what¡¯s apart followers?¡± harry asked swiftly 
thought saw sirius lupin exchange fleeting looks sirius answered 
¡°stuff get stealth 
¡± harry continued look puzzled, sirius said, ¡°like weapon 
something didn¡¯t last time 
¡± ¡°when powerful before?¡± ¡°yes 
¡± ¡°like kind weapon?¡± said harry 
¡°something worse avada kedavra -?¡± ¡°that¡¯s enough!¡± mrs

¡°oh, yeah, mother andromeda favorite cousin,¡± said sirius, examining tapestry closely 
¡°no, andromeda¡¯s either, look -¡± pointed another small round burn mark two names, bellatrix narcissa

completely fleshless, black coats clinging skeletons, every bone visible 
heads dragonish, pupil-less eyes white staring 
wings sprouted wither - vast, black leathery wings looked though ought belong giant bats 
standing still quiet gathering gloom, creatures looked eerie sinister 
harry could understand coaches pulled horrible horses quite capable moving along 
¡°where¡¯s pig?¡± said ron¡¯s voice, right behind harry 
¡°that luna girl carrying him,¡± said harry, turning quickly, eager consult ron hagrid 
¡°where d¡¯you reckon hagrid is? dunno,¡± said ron, sounding worried 
¡°he¡¯d better okay

¡°thanks,¡± said hennione, relieving ginny cat 
¡°come on, let¡¯s get carriage together fill 


¡± ¡°i haven¡¯t got pig yet!¡± ron said, hermione already heading towards nearest unoccupied coach 
harry remained behind ron 
¡°what things, d¡¯you reckon?¡± asked ron, nodding horrible horses students surged past 
¡°what things?¡± ¡°those horse -¡± luna appeared holding pigwidgeon¡¯s cage arms; tiny owl twittering excitedly usual 
¡°here are,¡± said 
¡°he¡¯s sweet little owl, isn¡¯t he?¡± ¡°er

¡°well, come then, let¡¯s get

¡°what horse things?¡± ¡°the horse things pulling carriages!¡± said harry impatiently 
were, all, three feet nearest one; watching empty white eyes 
ron, however, gave harry perplexed look 
¡°what talking about?¡± ¡°i¡¯m talking - look!¡± harry grabbed ron¡¯s arm wheeled face face winged horse 
ron stared straight second, looked back harry 
¡°what supposed looking at?¡± ¡°at - there, shafts! harnessed coach! it¡¯s right front ron continued look bemused, strange thought occurred harry 
¡°can¡¯t

¡°are feeling right, harry?¡± ¡°i

¡± harry felt utterly bewildered 
horse front him, gleaming solidly dim light issuing station windows behind them, vapour rising nostrils chilly night air 
yet, unless ron faking - feeble joke - ron could see 
¡°shall get in, then?¡± said ron uncertainly, looking harry though worried 
¡°yeah,¡± said harry 
¡°yeah, go 


¡± ¡°it¡¯s right,¡± said dreamy voice beside harry ron vanished coach¡¯s dark interior 
¡°you¡¯re going mad anything

¡± ¡°can you?¡± said harry desperately, turning luna 
could see bat-winged horses reflected wide silvery eyes 
¡°oh, yes,¡± said luna, ¡°i¡¯ve able see ever since first day 
they¡¯ve always pulled carriages 
don¡¯t worry 
you¡¯re sane am¡± smiling faintly, climbed musty interior carriage ron 
altogether reassured, harry followed 
chapter eleven sorting hat¡¯s new song harry want tell others luna hallucination, was, said nothing horses sat inside carriage slammed door behind 
nevertheless, could help watching silhouettes horses moving beyond window 
¡°did everyone see grubbly-plank woman?¡± asked ginny 
¡°what¡¯s back here? hagrid can¡¯t left, he?¡± ¡°i¡¯ll quite glad has,¡± said luna, ¡°he isn¡¯t good teacher, he?¡± ¡°yes, is!¡± said harry, ron ginny angrily 
harry glared hermione 
cleared throat quickly said, ¡°erm 


yes 


he¡¯s good 
¡± ¡°well, ravenclaw think he¡¯s bit joke,¡± said luna, unfazed 
¡°you¡¯ve got rubbish sense humor then,¡± ron snapped, wheels creaked motion 
luna seem perturbed ron¡¯s rudeness; contrary, simply watched though mildly interesting television program 
rattling swaying, carriages moved convoy road 
passed tall stone pillars topped winged boars either side gates school grounds, harry leaned forwards try see whether lights hagrid¡¯s cabin forbidden forest, grounds complete darkness 
hogwarts castle, however, loomed ever closer: towering mass turrets, jet black dark sky, window blazing fiery bright 
carriages jingled halt near stone steps leading oak front doors harry got carriage first 
turned look lit windows forest, definitely sign life within hagrids cabin 
unwillingly, half-hoped would vanished, turned eyes instead upon strange, skeletal creatures standing quietly chill night air, blank white eyes gleaming 
harry experience seeing something ron could not, reflection mirror, something much insubstantial hundred solid looking beasts strong enough pull fleet carriages 
luna believed, beasts always invisible 
why, then, could harry suddenly see them, could ron not? ¡°are coming what¡± said ron beside 
¡°oh 


yeah,¡± said harry quickly joined crowd hurrying stone steps castle 
entrance hall ablaze torches echoing footsteps students crossed flagged stone floor double doors right, leading great hall start-of- tenn feast 
four long house tables great hall filling starless black ceiling, like sky could glimpse high windows 
candles floated midair along tables, illuminating silvery ghosts dotted hall faces students talking eagerly, exchanging summer news, shouting greetings friends houses, eyeing one another¡¯s new haircuts robes 
again, harry noticed people putting heads together whisper passed; gritted teeth tried act though neither noticed cared 
luna drifted away ravenclaw table 
moment reached gryffindors, ginny hailed fellow fourth-years left sit them; harry, ron, hennione neville found seats together halfway table nearly headless nick, gryffindor house ghost, parvati patil lavender brown, last two gave harry airy, overly-friendly greetings made quite sure stopped talking split second 
important things worry about, however: looking students¡¯ heads staff table ran along top wall hall 
¡°he¡¯s 
¡± ron hennione scanned staff table too, though real need; hagrid¡¯s size made instantly obvious lineup 
¡°he can¡¯t left,¡± said ron, sounding slightly anxious 
¡°of course hasn¡¯t,¡± said harry finnly 
¡°you don¡¯t think he¡¯s 


hurt, anything, you?¡± said hennione uneasily 
¡°no,¡± said harry 
¡°but he, then?¡± pause, harry said quietly, neville, parvati lavender could hear, ¡°maybe he¡¯s back yet 
know - mission - thing summer dumbledore 
¡¯ ¡°yeah 


yeah, that¡¯ll it,¡± said ron, sounding reassured, hennione bit lip, looking staff table though hoping conclusive explanation hagrid¡¯s absence 
¡°who¡¯s that?¡± said sharply, pointing towards middle staff table 
harry¡¯s eyes followed 
lit first upon professor dumbledore, sitting high-backed golden chair center long staff table, wearing deep-purple robes scattered silvery stars matching hat 
dumbledore ¡¯s head inclined towards woman sitting next him, talking ear 
looked, harry thought, like somebody¡¯s maiden aunt: squat, short, curly, mouse-brown hair placed horrible pink alice band matched fluffy pink cardigan wore robes 
turned face slightly take sip goblet saw, shock recognition, pallid, toadlike face pair prominent, pouchy eyes 
¡°it¡¯s umbridge woman!¡± ¡°who?¡± said hennione 
¡°she hearing, works fudge!¡± ¡°nice cardigan,¡± said ron, smirking 
¡°she works fudge!¡± hennione repeated, frowning 
¡°what earth¡¯s here, then?¡± ¡°dunno 


¡± hennione scanned staff table, eyes narrowed 
¡°no,¡± muttered, ¡°no, surely 


¡± hany understand talking ask; attention caught professor grubbly-plank appeared behind staff table; worked way along end took seat ought hagrids 
meant first-years must crossed lake reached castle, sure enough, seconds later, doors entrance hall opened 
long line scared-looking first-years entered, led professor mcgonagall, carrying stool sat ancient wizard¡¯s hat, heavily patched darned wide rip near frayed brim 
buzz talk great hall faded away 
first-years lined front staff table facing rest students, professor mcgonagall placed stool carefully front them, stood back 
first-years¡¯ faces glowed palely candlelight 
small boy right middle row looked though trembling 
harry recalled, fleetingly, terrified felt stood there, waiting unknown test would determine house belonged 
whole school waited bated breath 
rip near hat¡¯s brim opened wide like mouth sorting hat burst song: times old new, hogwarts barely started, founders noble school, thought never parted, united common goal, selfsame yearning, make world's best magic school, pass along learning 
¡° together build teach!" four good friends decided, never dream, might day divided, friends anywhere, slytherin gryffindor? unless second pair hufflepuff ravenclaw? could gone wrong? could friendships fail? why, tell, whole sad, sorry tale 
said slytherin, ¡° we'll teach whose ancestry purest 
" said ravenclaw, ¡° we'll teach whose intelligence surest 
" said gryffindor, ¡° we'll teach brave deeds name 
" said hufflepuff, ¡® 77 / teach lot, treat 
¡± differences caused little strife, first came light, four founders house might take wanted, so, instance, slytherin took pure-blood wizards great cunning, like him, sharpest mind taught ravenclaw bravest boldest went daring gryffindor 
good hufflepuff took rest, taught knew, thus houses founders retained friendships firm true 
hogwarts worked harmony several happy years, discord crept among us feeding faults fears 
houses that, like pillars four, held school, turned upon and, divided, sought rule 
seemed school must meet early end, dueling fighting clash friend friend last came morning old slytherin departed though fighting died left us quite downhearted 
never since founders four whittled three houses united meant 
sorting hat know score: sort houses tm for, year fll go further, listen closely song: though condemned split still worry wrong, though must fulfill duty must quarter eveiy year still wonder whether sorting may bring end fear 
oh, know perils, read signs, warning history shows, hogwarts danger external, deadly foes must unite inside we'll crumble within told you, warned 


let sorting begin 
hat became motionless more; applause broke out, though punctured, first time harry¡¯s memory, muttering whispers 
across great hall students exchanging remarks neighbors, harry, clapping along everyone else, knew exactly talking 
¡°branched bit year, hasn¡¯t it?¡± said ron, eyebrows raised 
¡°too right has,¡± said harry 
sorting hat usually confined describing different qualities looked four hogwarts houses role sorting 
harry could remember ever trying give school advice 
¡°i wonder it¡¯s ever given warnings before?¡± said hennione, sounding slightly anxious 
¡°yes, indeed,¡± said nearly headless nick knowledgeably, leaning across neville towards (neville winced; uncomfortable ghost lean you) 
¡°the hat feels honor-bound give school due warning whenever feels ¡ª ¡± professor mcgonagall, waiting read list first-years¡¯ names, giving whispering students sort look scorches 
nearly headless nick placed see- finger lips sat primly upright muttering came abrupt end 
last frowning look swept four house tables, professor mcgonagall lowered eyes long piece parchment called first name 
¡°abercrombie, euan 
¡± terrified-looking boy harry noticed earlier stumbled forwards put hat head; prevented falling right shoulders prominent ears 
hat considered moment, rip near brim opened shouted: ¡°gryffindor!¡± harry clapped loudly rest gryffindor house euan abercrombie staggered table sat down, looking though would like much sink floor never looked 
slowly, long line first-years thinned 
pauses names sorting hat¡¯s decisions, harry could hear ron¡¯s stomach rumbling loudly 
finally, ¡°zeller, rose¡± sorted hufflepuff, professor mcgonagall picked hat stool marched away professor dumbledore rose feet 
whatever recent bitter feelings towards headmaster, harry somehow soothed see dumbledore standing 
absence hagrid presence dragonish horses, felt return hogwarts, long anticipated, full unexpected surprises, like jarring notes familiar song 
this, least, supposed be: headmaster rising greet start-of-term feast 
¡°to newcomers,¡± said dumbledore ringing voice, anns stretched wide beaming smile lips, ¡°welcome! old hands - welcome back! time speechmaking, 
tuck in!¡± appreciative laugh outbreak applause dumbledore sat neatly threw long beard shoulder keep way plate - food appeared nowhere, five long tables groaning joints pies dishes vegetables, bread sauces flagons pumpkin juice 
¡°excellent,¡± said ron, kind groan longing, seized nearest plate chops began piling plate, watched wistfully nearly headless nick 
¡°what saying sorting?¡± hennione asked ghost 
¡°about hat giving warnings?¡± ¡°oh, yes,¡± said nick, seemed glad reason turn away ron, eating roast potatoes almost indecent enthusiasm 
¡°yes, heard hat give several warnings before, always times detects periods great danger school 
always, course, advice same: stand together, strong within 
¡± ¡°ow kunnit nofe skusin danger ifzat?¡± said ron 
mouth full harry thought quite achievement make noise 
¡°i beg pardon?¡± said nearly headless nick politely, hennione looked revolted 
ron gave enormous swallow said, ¡°how kn ow school¡¯s danger it¡¯s hat?¡± ¡°i idea,¡± said nearly headless nick 
¡°of course, lives dumbledore¡¯s office, daresay picks things 
¡± ¡°and wants houses friends?¡± said harry, looking slytherin table, draco malfoy holding court 
¡°fat chance 
¡± ¡°well, now, shouldn¡¯t take attitude,¡± said nick reprovingly 
¡°peaceful cooperation, that¡¯s key 
ghosts, though belong separate houses, maintain li nk friendship 
spite competitiveness gryffindor slytherin, would never dream seeking argument bloody baron 
¡± ¡°only you¡¯re terrified him,¡± said ron 
nearly headless nick looked highly affronted 
¡°terrified? hope i, sir nicholas de mimsy-porpington, never guilty cowardice life! noble blood runs veins ¡°what blood?¡± asked ron 
¡°surely haven¡¯t still got -?¡± ¡°its figure speech!¡± said nearly headless nick, annoyed head trembling ominously partially severed neck 
¡°i assume still allowed enjoy use whichever words like, even pleasures eating drinking denied me! quite used students poking fun death, assure you!¡± ¡°nick, wasn¡¯t really laughing you!¡± said hennione, throwing furious look ron 
unfortunately, ron¡¯s mouth packed exploding point could manage ¡°node iddum eentup sechew,¡± nick seem think constituted adequate apology 
rising air, straightened feathered hat swept away end table, coming rest creevey brothers, colin dennis 
¡°well done, ron,¡± snapped hennione 
¡°what?¡± said ron indignantly, managed, finally, swallow food 
¡°i¡¯m allowed ask simple question?¡± ¡°oh, forget it,¡± said hennione initably, pair spent rest meal huffy silence 
harry used bickering bother trying reconcile them; felt better use time eat way steadily steak kidney pie, large plateful favorite treacle tart 
students finished eating noise level hall starting creep upwards again, dumbledore got feet 
talking ceased immediately turned lace headmaster 
harry feeling pleasantly drowsy 
four-poster bed waiting somewhere above, wonderfully warm soft 


¡°well, digesting another magnificent feast, beg moments attention usual start-of-term notices,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°first-years ought know forest grounds out-of-bounds students - older students ought know now,

¡°we two changes staffing year 
pleased welcome back professor grubbly-plank, taking care magical creatures lessons; also delighted introduce professor umbridge, new defense dark arts teacher 
¡± round polite fairly unenthusiastic applause, harry, ron hennione exchanged slightly panicked looks; dumbledore said long grubbly- plank would teaching 
dumbledore continued, ¡°tryouts house quidditch teams take place broke off, looking enquiringly professor umbridge 
much taller standing sitting, moment nobody understood dumbledore stopped talking, professor umbridge cleared throat, ¡°hem, hem,¡± became clear got feet intending make speech 
dumbledore looked taken aback moment, sat smartly looked alertly professor umbridge though desired nothing better listen talk 
members staff adept hiding surprise 
professor sprout¡¯s eyebrows disappeared flyaway hair professor mcgonagall¡¯s mouth thin harry ever seen 
new teacher ever interrupted dumbledore 
many students smirking; woman obviously know things done hogwarts 
¡°thank you, headmaster,¡± professor umbridge simpered, ¡°for kind words welcome 
¡± voice high-pitched, breathy little-girlish and, again, harry felt powerful rush dislike could explain himself; knew loathed everything her, stupid voice fluffy pink cardigan 
gave another little throat-clearing cough (¡°hem, hem¡±) continued 
¡°well, lovely back hogwarts, must say!¡± smiled, revealing pointed teeth 
¡°and see happy little faces looking me!¡± harry glanced around 
none faces could see looked happy 
contrary, looked rather taken-aback addressed though five years old 
¡°i much looking forward getting know i¡¯m sure we¡¯ll good friends!¡± students exchanged looks this; barely concealing grins 
¡°i¡¯ll friend long don¡¯t borrow cardigan,¡± parvati whispered lavender, lapsed silent giggles 
professor umbridge cleared throat (¡°hem, hem¡±), continued, breathiness vanished voice 
sounded much businesslike words dull learned-by-heart sound 
¡°the ministry magic always considered education young witches wizards vital importance 
rare gifts born may come nothing nurtured honed careful instruction 
ancient skills unique wizarding community must passed generations lest lose ever 
treasure trove magical knowledge amassed ancestors must guarded, replenished polished called noble profession teaching 
¡± professor umbridge paused made little bow fellow staff members, none bowed back 
professor mcgonagall¡¯s dark eyebrows contracted looked positively hawklike, harry distinctly saw exchange significant glance professor sprout umbridge gave another little ¡°hem, hem¡± went speech 
¡°every headmaster headmistress hogwarts brought something new weighty task governing historic school, be, without progress stagnation decay 
again, progress progress¡¯s sake must discouraged, tried tested traditions often require tinkering 
balance, then, old new, permanence change, tradition innovation 


¡± harry found attentiveness ebbing, though brain slipping tune 
quiet always filled hall dumbledore speaking breaking students put heads together, whispering giggling 
ravenclaw table cho chang chatting animatedly friends

meanwhile, hufflepuff table ernie macmillan one still staring professor umbridge, glassy-eyed harry sure pretending listen attempt live new prefect¡¯s badge gleaming chest 
professor umbridge seem notice restlessness audience 
harry impression full-scale riot could broken nose would ploughed speech 
teachers, however, still listening attentively, hermione seemed drinking every word umbridge spoke, though, judging expression, taste 
¡° 


changes better, others come, fullness time, recognized errors judgment 
meanwhile, old habits retained, rightly so, whereas others, outmoded outworn, must abandoned 
let us move forward, then, new era openness, effectiveness accountability, intent preserving ought preserved, perfecting needs perfected, pruning wherever find practices ought prohibited 
¡± sat 
dumbledore clapped 
staff followed lead, though harry noticed several brought hands together twice stopping 
students joined in, taken unawares end speech, listened words it, could start applauding properly, dumbledore stood 
¡°thank much, professor umbridge, illuminating,¡± said, bowing 
¡°now, saying, quidditch tryouts held 


¡± ¡°yes, certainly illuminating,¡± said hennione low voice 
¡°you¡¯re telling enjoyed it?¡± ron said quietly, turning glazed face towards hermione 
¡°that dullest speech i¡¯ve ever heard, grew percy

¡°how about: ¡®progress progress¡¯s sake must discouraged¡¯? about: ¡®pruning wherever find practices ought prohibited¡¯?¡± ¡°well, mean?¡± said ron impatiently 
¡°i¡¯ll tell means,¡± said hermione gritted teeth 
¡°it means ministry¡¯s interfering hogwarts 
¡± great clattering banging around them; dumbledore obviously dismissed school, everyone standing ready leave hall 
hennione jumped up, looking flustered 
¡°ron, we¡¯re supposed show first-years go!¡± ¡°oh yeah,¡± said ron, obviously forgotten 
¡°hey - hey, lot! midgets!¡± ¡°ron!¡± ¡°well, are, they¡¯re titchy

grinned 
blond boy next euan abercrombie looked petrified; nudged euan whispered something ear 
euan abercrombie looked equally frightened stole horrified look harry, felt grin slide face like stinksap 
¡°see later,¡± said dully ron hennione made way great hall alone, everything could ignore whispering, staring pointing passed 
kept eyes fixed ahead wove way crowd entrance hall, hurried marble staircase, took couple concealed short cuts soon left crowds behind

¡°not really,¡± said ron slowly 
¡°except

¡°what?¡± harry urged 
¡°¡®well, it¡¯d cool auror,¡¯¡° said ron off-hand voice 
¡°yeah, would,¡± said harry fervently 
¡°but they¡¯re, like, elite,¡± said ron

¡°we haven¡¯t got brains memory concentration - you¡¯re cleverer - nice rub in?¡± ¡°oh, don¡¯t give rubbish,¡± said hermione, looked slightly mollified led way damp courtyard 
fine misty drizzle falling, people standing huddles around edges yard looked blurred edges 
harry, ron hermione chose secluded comer heavily dripping balcony, turning collars robes chilly september air talking snape likely set first lesson year

¡°settle down,¡± said snape coldly, shutting door behind 
real need call order; moment class heard door close, quiet fallen fidgeting stopped 
snape¡¯s mere presence usually enough ensure class¡¯s silence 
¡°before begin today¡¯s lesson,¡± said snape, sweeping desk staring around all, ¡°i think appropriate remind next june sitting important examination, prove much learned composition use magical potions

¡°after year, course, many cease studying me,¡± snape went

¡°today mixing potion often comes ordinary wizarding level: draught peace, potion calm anxiety soothe agitation

harry¡¯s cauldron, however, snape stopped, looked horrible smirk face 
¡°potter, supposed be?¡± slytherins front class looked eagerly; loved hearing snape taunt harry 
¡°the draught peace,¡± said harry tensely 
¡°tell me, potter,¡± said snape softly, ¡°can read?¡± draco malfoy laughed 
¡°yes, can,¡± said harry, fingers clenched tightly around wand

¡°oh, shut up, pair you,¡± said harry heavily, ron opened mouth argue back 
hennione ron froze, looking angry offended 
¡°can¡¯t give rest?¡± said harry 
¡°you¡¯re always go other, it¡¯s driving mad

¡°oooooh!¡± said parvati lavender, thoroughly irritating harry 
anyone would thought hagrid never shown impressive creatures; admittedly, llobberwonns bit dull, salamanders hippogriffs interesting enough, blast-ended skrewts perhaps much 
¡°kindly keep voices down, girls!¡± said professor grubbly-plank sharply, scattering handful looked like brown rice among stick-creatures, immediately fell upon food 
¡°so - anyone know names creatures? miss granger?¡± ¡°bowtruckles,¡± said hermione

¡°where¡¯s hagrid?¡± asked her, everyone else choosing bowtruckles 
¡°never mind,¡± said professor grubbly-plank repressively, attitude last time hagrid failed turn class, 
smirking pointed face, draco malfoy leaned across harry seized largest bowtruckle 
¡°maybe,¡± said malfoy undertone, harry could hear him, ¡°the stupid great oafs got badly injured

¡°harry, don¡¯t go picking row malfoy, don¡¯t forget, he¡¯s prefect now, could make life difficult 


¡± ¡°wow, wonder it¡¯d like difficult life?¡± said harry sarcastically 
ron laughed, hermione frowned 
together, traipsed across vegetable patch 
sky still appeared unable make mind whether wanted rain 
¡°i wish hagrid would hurry get back, that¡¯s all,¡± said harry low voice, reached greenhouses 
¡°and don¡¯t say grubbly-plank woman¡¯s better teacher!¡± added threateningly

soared great circle, plunged back trees 
whole thing happened quickly, harry could hardly believe seen, except heart hammering madly 
owlery door opened behind

¡°the ministry suspects he¡¯s one dumbledore¡¯s lot - 1 dunno - lured ministry, wasn¡¯t trying get door all! maybe they¡¯ve made something get him!¡± pause harry hermione considered 
harry thought seemed farfetched 
hermione, hand, looked rather impressed

¡°right, well, think tackle essay sprout self-fertilizing shrubs first we¡¯re lucky we¡¯ll able start mcgonagall¡¯s inanimatus conjurus spell lunch 


¡± harry felt small twinge guilt thought pile homework awaiting upstairs, sky clear, exhilarating blue, firebolt week 


¡°i mean, tonight,¡± said ron, harry walked sloping lawns towards quidditch pitch, broomsticks shoulders, hermione¡¯s dire warnings would fail owls still ringing ears

¡°still, important, too, we¡¯ve got practice want stay quidditch team 


¡± ¡°yeah, that¡¯s right,¡± said ron, heartened tone 
¡°and got plenty time 


¡± approached quidditch pitch, harry glanced right trees forbidden forest swaying darkly 
nothing flew them; sky empty distant owls fluttering around owlery tower 
enough worry about; flying horse wasn¡¯t harm; pushed mind 
collected balls cupboard changing room set work, ron guarding three tall goalposts, harry playing chaser trying get quaffle past ron 
harry thought ron pretty good; blocked three-quarters goals harry attempted put past played better longer practiced 
couple hours returned castle lunch - hennione made quite clear thought irresponsible ¡ª returned quidditch pitch real training session 
teammates angelina already changing room entered 
¡°all right, ron?¡± said george, winking 
¡°yeah,¡± said ron, become quieter quieter way pitch 
¡°ready show us up, ickle prefect?¡± said fred, emerging tousle-haired neck quidditch robes, slightly malicious grin face 
¡°shut up,¡± said ron, stony-faced, pulling team robes first time 
fitted well considering oliver wood¡¯s, rather broader shoulder 
¡°okay, everyone,¡± said angelina, entering captain¡¯s office, already changed 
¡°let¡¯s get it; alicia fred, bring ball crate us 
oh, couple people watching want ignore them, right?¡± something would-be casual voice made harry think might know uninvited spectators were, sure enough, left changing room bright sunlight pitch storm catcalls jeers slytherin quidditch team assorted hangers-on, grouped halfway empty stands whose voices echoed loudly around stadium 
¡°what¡¯s weasley¡¯s riding?¡±¡¯ malfoy called sneering drawl 
¡°why would anyone put flying charm mouldy old log like that?¡± crabbe, goyle pansy parkinson guffawed shrieked laughter 
ron mounted broom kicked ground harry followed him, watching ears turn red behind 
¡°ignore them,¡± said, accelerating catch ron, ¡°we¡¯ll see who¡¯s laughing play 


¡± ¡°exactly attitude want, harry,¡± said angelina approvingly, soaring around quaffle arm slowing hover spot front airborne team

¡°why would anyone want look like they¡¯ve got worms coming head?¡± angelina swept long braided hair face continued calmly, ¡°spread out, then, let¡¯s see 


¡± harry reversed away others far side pitch 
ron fell back towards opposite goal 
angelina raised quaffle one hand threw hard fred, passed george, passed harry, passed ron, dropped 
slytherins, led malfoy, roared screamed laughter 
ron, pelted towards ground catch quaffle landed, pulled dive untidily, slipped sideways broom, returned playing height, blushing 
harry saw fred george exchange looks, uncharacteristically neither said anything, grateful 
¡°pass on, ron,¡± called angelina, though nothing happened 
ron threw quaffle alicia, passed back harry, passed george 


¡°hey, potter, how¡¯s scar feeling?¡± called malfoy 
¡°sure don¡¯t need lie down? must be, what, whole week since hospital wing, that¡¯s record you, isn¡¯t it?¡± george passed angelina; reverse-passed harry, expecting it, caught tips fingers passed quickly ron, lunged missed inches 
¡°come now, ron,¡± said angelina crossly, dived ground again, chasing quaffle 
¡°pay attention 
¡± would hard say whether ron¡¯s face quaffle deeper scarlet returned playing height 
malfoy rest slytherin team howling laughter 
third attempt, ron caught quaffle; perhaps relief passed enthusiastically soared straight katie¡¯s outstretched hands hit hard face 
¡°sorry!¡± ron groaned, zooming forwards see whether done damage 
¡°get back position, she¡¯s fine!¡± barked angelina 
¡°but you¡¯re passing teammate, try knock broom, won¡¯t you? we¡¯ve got bludgers that!¡± katie¡¯s nose bleeding 
below, slytherins stamping feet jeering 
fred george converged katie 
¡°here, take this,¡± fred told her, handing something small purple pocket, ¡°it¡¯ll clear time 
¡± ¡°all right,¡± called angelina, ¡°fred, george, go get bats bludger 
ron, get goalposts 
harry, release snitch say

¡°he¡¯s nervous,¡± said harry, ¡°he fine practicing morning 
¡± ¡°yeah, well, hope hasn¡¯t peaked soon,¡± said fred gloomily 
returned air 
angelina blew whistle, harry released snitch fred george let fly bludger 
moment on, harry barely aware others 
job recapture tiny fluttering golden ball worth hundred fifty points seeker¡¯s team required enormous speed skill 
accelerated, rolling swerving chasers, warm autumn air whipping face, distant yells slytherins much meaningless roaring ears 


soon, whistle brought halt 
¡°stop - stop - stop!¡± screamed angelina 
¡°ron - you¡¯re covering middle post!¡± harry looked round ron, hovering front left-hand hoop, leaving two completely unprotected 
¡°oh 


sorry 


¡± ¡°you keep shifting around you¡¯re watching chasers!¡± said angelina 
¡°either stay center position move defend hoop, else circle hoops, don¡¯t drift vaguely one side, that¡¯s let last three goals!¡± ¡°sorry 


¡± ron repeated, red face shining like beacon bright blue sky 
¡°and katie, can¡¯t something nosebleed?¡± ¡°it¡¯s getting worse!¡± said katie thickly, attempting stem flow sleeve 
harry glanced round fred, looking anxious checking pockets 
saw fred pull something purple, examine second look round katie, evidently horror-struck 
¡°well, let¡¯s try again,¡± said angelina 
ignoring slytherins, set chant ¡°gryffindor losers, gryffindor losers,¡± certain rigidity seat broom nevertheless 
time flying barely three minutes angelina¡¯s whistle sounded 
harry, sighted snitch circling opposite goalpost, pulled feeling distinctly aggrieved 
¡°what now?¡± said impatiently alicia, nearest 
¡°katie,¡± said shortly 
harry turned saw angelina, fred george flying fast could towards katie 
harry alicia sped towards her, 
plain angelina stopped training time; katie chalk white covered blood 
¡°she needs hospital wing,¡± said angelina 
¡°we¡¯ll take her,¡± said fred 
¡°she - er - might swallowed blood blisterpod mistake ¡°well, there¡¯s point continuing beaters chaser gone,¡± said angelina glumly fred george zoomed towards castle supporting katie 
¡°come on, let¡¯s go get changed 
¡± slytherins continued chant trailed back changing rooms 
¡°how practice?¡± asked hermione rather coolly half hour later, harry ron climbed portrait hole gryffindor common room 
¡°it harry began 
¡°completely lousy,¡± said ron hollow voice, sinking chair beside hennione 
looked ron frostiness seemed melt 
¡°well, first one,¡± said consolingly, ¡°it¡¯s bound take time ¡°who said made lousy?¡± snapped ron 
¡°no one,¡± said hermione, looking taken aback, ¡°i thought ¡°you thought bound rubbish?¡± ¡°no, course didn¡¯t! look, said lousy ¡°i¡¯m going get started homework,¡± said ron angrily stomped staircase boys¡¯ dormitories vanished sight 
hermione turned harry 
¡°was lousy?¡± ¡°no,¡± said harry loyally 
hermione raised eyebrows 
¡°well, suppose could¡¯ve played better,¡± harry muttered, ¡°but first training session, like said 


¡± neither harry ron seemed make much headway homework night 
harry knew ron preoccupied badly performed quidditch practice difficulty getting ¡°gryffindor losers¡± chant head 
spent whole sunday common room, buried books room around filled up, emptied 
another clear, fine day fellow gryffindors spent day grounds, enjoying might well last sunshine year 
evening, harry felt though somebody beating brain inside skull 
¡°you know, probably try get homework done week,¡± harry muttered ron, finally laid aside professor mcgonagall¡¯s long essay inanimatus conjurus spell turned miserably professor sinistra¡¯ equally long difficult essay jupiter¡¯s many moons 
¡°yeah,¡± said ron, rubbing slightly bloodshot eyes throwing fifth spoiled bit parchment fire beside 
¡°listen 


shall ask hennione look she¡¯s done?¡± harry glanced her; sitting crookshanks lap chatting merrily ginny pair knitting needles flashed midair front her, knitting pair shapeless elf socks 
¡°no,¡± said heavily, ¡°you know won¡¯t let us 
¡± worked sky outside windows became steadily darker 
slowly, crowd common room began thin 
half past eleven, hennione wandered them, yawning 
¡°nearly done?¡± ¡°no,¡± said ron shortly 
¡°jupiter¡¯s biggest moon ganymede, callisto,¡± said, pointing ron¡¯s shoulder line astronomy essay, ¡°and it¡¯s lo that¡¯s got volcanoes

¡°sorry, ¡°yeah, well, you¡¯ve come criticize ¡°ron ¡°i haven¡¯t got time listen sermon, right, hennione, i¡¯m neck ¡°no - look!¡± hermione pointing nearest window 
harry ron looked 
handsome screech owl standing windowsill, gazing room ron 
¡°isn¡¯t hermes?¡± said hennione, sounding amazed 
¡°blimey, is!¡± said ron quietly, throwing quill getting feet 
¡°what¡¯s percy writing for?¡± crossed window opened it; hennes flew inside, landed ron¡¯s essay held leg letter attached 
ron took letter owl departed once, leaving inky footprints across ron¡¯s drawing moon lo

looked two 
¡°what d¡¯you reckon?¡± ¡°open it!¡± said hermione eagerly, harry nodded 
ron unrolled scroll began read 
parchment eyes traveled, pronounced became scowl 
finished reading, looked disgusted 
thrust letter harry hennione, leaned towards read together: dear ron, heard (from less person minister magic new teacher, professor umbridge) become hogwarts prefect 
pleasantly surprised heard news must firstly offer congratulations 
must admit always afraid would take might call ¡® fred george¡¯¡¯ route, rather following footsteps, imagine feelings hearing stopped flouting authority decided shoulder real responsibility 
want give congratulations, ron, want give advice, sending night rather usual morning post 
hopefully, able read away prying eyes avoid awkward questions 
something minister let slip telling prefect, gather still seeing lot harry potter 
must tell you, ron, nothing could put danger losing badge continued fraternization boy 
yes, lam sure surprised hear - doubt say potter always dumbledore's favorite ¡ª feel bound tell dumb ledore may charge hogwarts much longer people count different - probably accurate - view potter's behavior

must aware, given father escorted court, potter disciplinary hearing summer front whole wizengamot come looking good 
got mere technicality, ask me, many people pve spoken remain convinced guilt 
may afraid sever ties potter - 1 know unbalanced and, know, violent - worries this, spotted anything else potter's behavior troubling you, urge speak dolores umbridge, truly delightful woman know happy advise 
leads bit advice 
hinted above, dumbledore's regime hogwarts may soon

brother, percy harry looked ron 
¡°well,¡± said, trying sound though found whole thing joke, ¡°if want - er - it?¡± - checked percy¡¯s letter - ¡°oh yeah - ¡®severe ties¡¯ me, swear won¡¯t get violent 
¡± ¡°give back,¡± said ron, holding hand

¡°thanks million, hermione,¡± said harry weakly, passing essay sinking back annchair, rubbing eyes 
past midnight common room deserted three crookshanks 
sound hermione ¡¯s quill scratching sentences essays ruffle pages checked various facts reference books strewn across table 
harry exhausted 
also felt odd, sick, empty feeling stomach nothing tiredness everything letter curling blackly heart fire 
knew half people inside hogwarts thought strange, even mad; knew daily prophet making snide allusions months, something seeing written like percys writing, knowing percy advising ron drop even tell tales umbridge, made situation real nothing else 
known percy four years, stayed house summer holidays, shared tent quidditch world cup, even awarded full marks second task triwizard tournament last year, yet now, percy thought unbalanced possibly violent 
surge sympathy godfather, harry thought sirius probably person knew could really understand felt moment, sirius situation 
nearly everyone wizarding world thought sirius dangerous murderer great voldemort supporter live knowledge fourteen years 


harry blinked

¡°you sound like molly,¡± said sirius 
¡°this way could come answering harrys letter without resorting code - codes breakable 
¡± mention harry¡¯s letter, hermione ron turned stare 
¡°you didn¡¯t say you¡¯d written sirius!¡± said hermione accusingly

¡± pause this, ron said, ¡°that¡¯s stupid thing i¡¯ve ever heard, including stuff luna lovegood comes 
¡± ¡°so we¡¯re prevented learning defense dark arts fudge scared we¡¯ll use spells ministry?¡± said hennione, looking furious

unfortunately, angelina see

wind picking up; even distance harry could hear swishing, pounding sounds rain pummeling surface lake 
angelina kept nearly hour conceding defeat 
led sodden disgruntled team back changing rooms, insisting practice waste time, though without real conviction voice 
fred george looking particularly annoyed; bandy-legged winced every movement 
harry could hear complaining low voices toweled hair dry 
¡°i think mine ruptured,¡± said fred hollow voice 
¡°mine haven¡¯t,¡± said george, clenched teeth, ¡°they¡¯re throbbing like mad

¡± ¡°ouch!¡± said harry 
pressed towel face, eyes screwed tight pain 
scar forehead seared again, painfully weeks 
¡°what¡¯s up?¡± said several voices 
harry emerged behind towel; changing room blurred wearing glasses, could still tell everyone¡¯s face turned towards 
¡°nothing,¡± muttered, ¡°i - poked eye, that¡¯s 
¡± gave ron significant look two hung back rest team filed back outside, muffled cloaks, hats pulled low ears 
¡°what happened?¡± said ron, moment alicia disappeared door 
¡°was scar?¡± harry nodded 
¡°but 


¡± looking scared, ron strode across window stared rain, ¡°he - can¡¯t near us now, he?¡± ¡°no,¡± harry muttered, sinking bench rubbing forehead 
¡°he¡¯s probably miles away

confused tangle shapes, howling rush voices 


¡°he wants something done, it¡¯s happening fast enough,¡± said 
again, felt surprised hear words coming mouth, yet quite certain true 
¡°but

harry shook head covered eyes hands, pressing upon palms 
little stars erupted 
felt ron sit bench beside knew ron staring 
¡°is last time?¡± said ron hushed voice 
¡°when scar hurt umbridge¡¯s office? you-know-who angry?¡± harry shook head 
¡°what it, then?¡± harry thinking back 
looking umbridge¡¯s face

¡°last time, pleased,¡± said 
¡°really pleased

¡°he furious 
¡± looked round ron, gaping 
¡°you could take trelawney, mate,¡± said awed voice 
¡°i¡¯m making prophecies,¡± said harry 
¡°no, know you¡¯re doing?¡± ron said, sounding scared impressed 
¡°harry, you¡¯re reading you-know-who ¡¯s mind!¡± ¡°no,¡± said harry, shaking head 
¡°it¡¯s like

¡°you¡¯ve got tell someone,¡± said ron 
¡°i told sirius last time 
¡± ¡°well, tell time!¡± ¡°can¡¯t, i?¡± said harry grimly 
¡°umbridge watching ¡°well then, dumbledore

¡°there¡¯s point telling

¡°dumbledore¡¯d want know,¡± said 
harry shrugged 
¡°c¡¯rnon

harry thinking hard 
voldemort wanted done happening quickly enough? " 


he¡¯s got plans 


plans put operation quietly indeed

¡°dobby?¡± said harry thickly, peering gloom towards source voice 
dobby house-elf standing beside table hermione left half dozen knitted hats 
large, pointed ears sticking beneath looked like hats hermione ever knitted; wearing one top other, head seemed elongated two three feet, topmost bobble sat hedwig, hooting serenely obviously cured 
¡°dobby volunteered return harry potter¡¯s owl,¡± said elf squeakily, look positive adoration face, ¡°professor grubbly-plank says well now, sir

¡± expected elf smile vanish, ears droop; expected say impossible, else would try find somewhere, hopes high 
expected dobby give little skip, ears waggling cheerfully, clap hands together 
¡°dobby knows perfect place, sir!¡± said happily 
¡°dobby heard tell house-elves came hogwarts, sir

¡°because room person enter,¡± said dobby seriously, ¡°when real need

dobby knows mr 
filch found extra cleaning materials run short, sir, ¡°and really needed bathroom,¡± said harry, suddenly remembering something dumbledore said yule ball previous christmas, ¡°would fill chamber pots?¡± ¡°dobby expects so, sir,¡± said dobby, nodding earnestly

¡°this really important

listen, tell exactly room requirement is, get there?¡± robes billowed swirled around splashed across flooded vegetable patch double herbology, could hardly hear professor sprout saying hammering raindrops hard hailstones greenhouse roof 
afternoons care magical creatures lesson relocated storm-swept grounds free classroom ground floor and, intense relief, angelina sought team lunch tell quidditch practice cancelled 
¡°good,¡± said harry quietly, told him, ¡°because we¡¯ve found somewhere first defense meeting

harry returned hungrily sausages mash

¡°what?¡± said thickly 
¡°well 


it¡¯s dobby¡¯s plans aren¡¯t always safe 
don¡¯t remember lost bones arm?¡± ¡°this room isn¡¯t mad idea dobby¡¯s; dumbledore knows it, too, mentioned yule ball 
¡± hermione¡¯s expression cleared 
¡°dumbledore told it?¡± ¡°just passing,¡± said harry, shrugging 
¡°oh, well, that¡¯s right then,¡± said hennione briskly raised objections 
together ron spent day seeking people signed names list hog¡¯s head telling meet evening 
somewhat harry¡¯s disappointment, ginny managed find cho chang friend first; however, end dinner confident news passed every one twenty-five people turned hog¡¯s head 
half past seven harry, ron hennione left gryffindor common room, harry clutching certain piece aged parchment hand 
fifth-years allowed corridors nine o¡¯clock, three kept looking around nervously made way along seventh floor 
¡°hold it,¡± harry warned, unfolding piece parchment top last staircase, tapping wand muttering, ¡°i solemnly swear good 
¡± map hogwarts appeared bla nk surface parchment 
tiny black moving dots, labeled names, showed various people 
¡°filch second floor,¡± said harry, holding map close eyes, ¡°and mrs

¡°in office,¡± said harry, pointing 
¡°okay, lets go 
¡± hurried along corridor place dobby described harry, stretch bla nk wall opposite enormous tapestry depicting barnabas barmy¡¯s foolish attempt train trolls ballet 
¡°okay,¡± said harry quietly, moth-eaten troll paused relentless clubbing would ballet teacher watch 
¡°dobby said walk past bit wall three times, concentrating hard need 
¡± so, turning sharply window beyond blank stretch wall, man- sized vase side 
ron screwed eyes concentration; hermione whispering something breath; harry¡¯s fists clenched stared ahead 
need somewhere learn fight 


thought 
give us place practice 


somewhere 7 find us 


¡°harry!¡± said hermione sharply, wheeled around third walk past 
highly polished door appeared wall 
ron staring it, looking slightly wary 
harry reached out, seized brass handle, pulled open door led way spacious room lit flickering torches like illuminated dungeons eight floors 
walls lined wooden bookcases instead chairs large silk cushions floor 
set shelves far end room carried range instruments sneakoscopes, secrecy sensors large, cracked foe-glass harry sure hung, previous year, fake moodys office 
¡°these good we¡¯re practicing stunning, ¡° said ron enthusiastically, prodding one cushions foot 
¡°and look books!¡± said hermione excitedly, running finger along spines large leather-bound tomes 
¡°a compendium common curses counter- actions 


dark arts outsmarted 


self-defensive spellwork 


wow 


¡± looked around harry, face glowing, saw presence hundreds books finally convinced hennione right 
¡°harry, wonderful, there¡¯s everything need here!¡± without ado slid ¡®jinxes jinxed¡¯ shelf, sank nearest cushion began read 
gentle knock door 
harry looked round 
ginny, neville, lavender, parvati dean arrived 
¡°whoa,¡± said dean, staring around, impressed 
¡°what place?¡± harry began explain, finished people arrived start 
time eight o¡¯clock arrived, every cushion occupied 
harry moved across door turned key protruding lock; clicked satisfyingly loud way everybody fell silent, looking 
hermione carefully marked page ¡®jinxes jinxed¡¯ set book aside 
¡°well,¡± said harry, slightly nervously 
¡°this place we¡¯ve found practice sessions, you¡¯ve - er - obviously found okay 
¡± ¡°it¡¯s fantastic!¡± said cho, several people murmured agreement 
¡°it¡¯s bizarre,¡± said fred, frowning around 
¡°we hid filch here, remember, george? broom cupboard 
¡± ¡°hey, harry, what¡¯s stuff?¡± asked dean rear room, indicating sneakoscopes foe-glass 
¡°dark detectors,¡± said harry, stepping cushions reach 
¡°basically show dark wizards enemies around, don¡¯t want rely much, fooled 


¡± gazed moment cracked foe-glass; shadowy figures moving around inside it, though none recognizable 
turned back 
¡°well, i¡¯ve thinking sort stuff ought first - er -¡± noticed raised hand 
¡°what, hermione?¡± ¡°i think ought elect leader,¡± said hermione 
¡°harry¡¯s leader,¡± said cho once, looking hermione though mad 
harrys stomach yet another back- flip 
¡°yes, think ought vote properly,¡± said hennione, unperturbed 
¡°it makes formal gives authority 
- everyone thinks harry ought leader?¡± everybody put hand, even zacharias smith, though half-heartedly 
¡°er - right, thanks,¡± said harry, could feel face burning 
¡°and -what, hennione?¡± ¡°i also think ought name,¡± said brightly, hand still air 
¡°it would promote feeling team spirit unity, don¡¯t think?¡± ¡°can anti-umbridge league?¡± said angelina hopefully 
¡°or ministry magic morons group?¡± suggested fred 
¡°i thinking,¡± said hennione, frowning fred, ¡°more name didn¡¯t tell everyone to, refer safely outside meetings 
¡± ¡°the defense association?¡± said cho 
¡°the 

short, nobody knows we¡¯re talking about?¡± ¡°yeah, 

¡¯s good,¡± said ginny 
¡°only let¡¯s make stand dumbledores army, that¡¯s ministry¡¯s worst fear, isn¡¯t it?¡± good deal appreciative murmuring laughter 
¡°all favor 

?¡± said hennione bossily, kneeling cushion count 
¡°that¡¯s majority - motion passed!¡± pinned piece parchment signatures wall wrote across top large letters: ¡°right,¡± said harry, sat again, ¡°shall get practicing then? thinking, first thing expelliannus, know, disarming chann 
know it¡¯s pretty basic i¡¯ve found really useful ¡°oh, please,¡± said zacharias smith, rolling eye folding arms 
¡°i don¡¯t think expelliannus exactly going help us you-know-who, you?¡± ¡°i¡¯ve used him,¡± said harry quietly 
¡°it saved life june 
¡± smith opened mouth stupidly 
rest room quiet 
¡°but think it¡¯s beneath you, leave,¡± harry said 
smith move 
anybody else 
¡°okay,¡± said harry, mouth slightly drier usual eyes upon him, ¡°i reckon divide pairs practice 
¡± felt odd issuing instructions, nearly odd seeing followed 
everybody got feet divided 
predictably, neville left partnerless 
¡°you practice me,¡± harry told 
¡°right-on count three, then-one, two, three-¡± room suddenly full shouts expelliannus 
wands flew directions; missed spells hit books shelves sent flying air 
harry quick neville, whose wand went spinning hand, hit ceiling shower sparks landed clatter top bookshelf, harry retrieved summoning charm 
glancing around, thought right suggest practice basics first; lot shoddy spellwork going on; many people succeeding disarming opponents all, merely causing jump backwards paces wince feeble spell whooshed 
¡°expelliannus!¡± said neville, harry, caught unawares, felt wand fly hand 
¡°i it!¡± said neville gleefully 
¡°eve never done - 1 it!¡± ¡°good one!¡± said harry encouragingly, deciding point real duel nevilles opponent unlikely staring opposite direction wand held loosely side 
¡°listen, neville, take turns practice ron hennione couple minutes walk around see rest doing?¡± harry moved middle room 
something odd happening zacharias smith 
every time opened mouth disarm anthony goldstein, wand would fly hand, yet anthony seem making sound 
harry look far solve mystery: fred george several feet smith taking turns point wands back 
¡°sorry, harry¡± said george hastily, harry caught eye 
¡°couldn¡¯t resist 
¡± harry walked around pairs, trying correct spell wrong 
ginny teamed michael corner; well, whereas michael either bad unwilling jinx 
ernie macmillan flourishing wand unnecessarily, giving partner time get guard; creevey brothers enthusiastic erratic mainly responsible books leaping shelves around them; luna lovegood similarly patchy, occasionally sending justin finch-fletchley¡¯s wand spinning hand, times merely causing hair stand end 
¡°okay, stop!¡± harry shouted 
¡°stop! stop!¡± need whistle, thought, immediately spotted one lying top nearest row books 
caught blew hard 
everyone lowered wands 
¡°that wasn¡¯t bad,¡± said harry, ¡°but there¡¯s definite room improvement 
¡± zacharias smith glared 
¡°let¡¯s try 
¡± moved around room again, stopping make suggestions 
slowly, general perfonnance improved 
avoided going near cho friend while, walking twice around every pair room felt could ignore longer 
¡°oh no,¡± said cho rather wildly approached 
¡°expelliarmious! mean, expellimellius! ! - oh, sorry, marietta!¡± curly-haired friend¡¯s sleeve caught fire; marietta extinguished wand glared harry though fault 
¡°you made nervous, right then!¡± cho told harry ruefully 
¡°that quite good,¡± harry lied, raised eyebrows said, ¡°well, no, lousy, know properly, watching 
¡± laughed 
friend marietta looked rather sourly turned away 
¡°don¡¯t mind her,¡± cho muttered 
¡°she doesn¡¯t really want made come 
parents forbidden anything might upset umbridge 
see - mum works ministry 
¡± ¡°what parents?¡± asked harry 
¡°well, they¡¯ve forbidden get wrong side umbridge, too,¡± said cho, drawing proudly 
¡°but think i¡¯m going fight you-know-who happened cedric broke off, looking rather confused, awkward silence fell them; terry boot¡¯s wand went whizzing past harry¡¯s ear hit alicia spinnet hard nose 
¡°well, dad supportive anti-ministry action!¡± said luna lovegood proudly behind harry; evidently eavesdropping conversation justin finch-fletchley attempted disentangle robes flown head 
¡°he¡¯s always saying he¡¯d believe anything fudge; mean, number goblins fudge assassinated! course uses department mysteries develop terrible poisons, secretly feeds anybody disagrees 
there¡¯s umgubular slashkilter ¡ª ¡± ¡°don¡¯t ask,¡± harry muttered cho opened mouth, looking puzzled 
giggled 
¡°hey, harry,¡± hermione called end room, ¡°have checked time?¡± looked watch shocked see already ten past nine, meant needed get back common rooms immediately risk caught punished filch bounds 
blew whistle; everybody stopped shouting ¡°expelliannus¡± last couple wands clattered floor 
¡°well, pretty good,¡± said harry, ¡°but we¡¯ve overrun, we¡¯d better leave 
time, place next week?¡± ¡°sooner!¡¯ said dean thomas eagerly many people nodded agreement 
angelina, however, said quickly 
¡°the quidditch season¡¯s start, need team practices too!¡± ¡°let¡¯s say next wednesday night, then,¡± said harry, ¡°we decide additional meetings 
come on, we¡¯d better get going 
¡± pulled marauder¡¯s map checked carefully signs teachers seventh floor 
let leave threes fours, watching tiny dots anxiously see returned safely donnitories: hufflepuffs basement corridor also led kitchens; ravenclaws tower west side castle, gryffindors along corridor fat lady¡¯s portrait 
¡°that really, really good, harry¡± said hermione, finally her, harry ron left 
¡°yeah, was!¡± said ron enthusiastically, slipped door watched melt back stone behind 
¡°did see disann hermione, harry?¡± ¡°only once,¡± said hermione, stung 
¡°i got loads got ¡°i get once, got least three times ¡°well, you¡¯re counting one tripped feet knocked wand hand argued way back common room, harry listening 
one eye marauder¡¯s map, also thinking cho saying made nervous 
chapter nineteen lion serpent harry felt though carrying kind talisman inside chest following two weeks, glowing secret supported umbridge¡¯s classes even made possible smile blandly looked horrible bulging eyes 


resisting nose, thing ministry feared, whenever supposed reading wilbert slinkhard¡¯s book lessons dwelled instead satisfying memories recent meetings, remembering neville successfully disarmed hermione, colin creevey mastered impediment jinx three meetings¡¯ hard effort, parvati patil produced good reductor curse reduced table carrying sneakoscopes dust 
finding almost impossible fix regular night week 

meetings, accommodate three separate team¡¯s quidditch practices, often rearranged due bad weather conditions; harry sorry this; feeling probably better keep timing meetings unpredictable 
anyone watching them, would hard make pattern 
hermione soon devised clever method communicating time date next meeting members case needed change short notice, would look suspicious people different houses seen crossing great hall talk often 
gave members 

fake galleon (ron became excited first saw basket convinced actually giving gold) 
¡°you see numerals around edge coins?¡± hennione said, holding one examination end fourth meeting 
coin gleamed fat yellow light torches 
¡°on real galleons that¡¯s serial number referring goblin cast coin 
fake coins, though, numbers change reflect time date next meeting 
coins grow hot date changes, you¡¯re carrying pocket you¡¯ll able feel 
take one each, harry sets date next meeting he¡¯ll change numbers coin, i¡¯ve put protean charm them, they¡¯ll change mimic 
¡± blank silence greeted hermione¡¯s words 
looked around faces upturned her, rather disconcerted 
¡°well - 1 thought good idea,¡± said uncertainly, ¡°i mean, even umbridge asked us turn pockets, there¡¯s nothing fishy carrying galleon, there? 


well, don¡¯t want use ¡°you protean charm?¡± said terry boot 
¡°yes,¡± said hermione 
¡°but that¡¯s 


that¡¯s newt standard, is,¡± said weakly 
¡°oh,¡± said hermione, trying look modest 
¡°oh 


well 


yes, suppose 
¡± ¡°how come you¡¯re ravenclaw?¡± demanded, staring hennione something close wonder 
¡°with brains like yours?¡± ¡°well, sorting hat seriously consider putting ravenclaw sorting,¡± said hermione brightly, ¡°but decided gryffindor end 
so, mean we¡¯re using galleons?¡± murmur assent everybody moved forwards collect one basket 
harry looked sideways hermione 
¡°you know remind of?¡± ¡°no, what¡¯s that?¡± ¡°the death eaters¡¯ scars 
voldemort touches one them, scars bum, know they¡¯ve got join 
¡± ¡°well 


yes,¡± said hennione quietly, ¡°that got idea you¡¯ll notice decided engrave date bits metal rather members¡¯ skin 
¡± ¡°yeah 


prefer way,¡± said harry, grinning, slipped galleon pocket 
¡°i suppose danger might accidentally spend 
¡± ¡°fat chance,¡± said ron, examining fake galleon slightly mournful air, ¡°i haven¡¯t got real galleons confuse 
¡± first quidditch match season, gryffindor versus slytherin, drew nearer, 

meetings put hold angelina insisted almost daily practices 
fact quidditch cup held long added considerably interest excitement surrounding forthcoming game; ravenclaws hufflepuffs taking lively interest outcome, they, course, would playing teams coming year; heads house competing teams, though attempted disguise decent pretence sportsmanship, detennined see side victorious 
harry realized much professor mcgonagall cared beating slytherin abstained giving homework week leading match 
¡°i thi nk you¡¯ve got enough getting moment,¡± said loftily 
nobody could quite believe ears looked directly harry ron said grimly, ¡°i¡¯ve become accustomed seeing quidditch cup study, boys, really don¡¯t want hand professor snape, use extra time practice, won¡¯t you?¡± snape less obviously partisan; booked quidditch pitch slytherin practice often gryffindors difficulty getting play 
also turning deaf ear many reports slytherin attempts hex gryffindor players corridors 
alicia spinnet turned hospital wing eyebrows growing thick fast obscured vision obstructed mouth, snape insisted must attempted hair-thickening charm refused listen fourteen eye-witnesses insisted seen slytherin keeper, miles bletchley, hit behind jinx worked library 
harry felt optimistic gryffindor¡¯s chances; had, all, never lost malfoy¡¯s team 
admittedly, ron still performing wood¡¯s standard, working extremely hard improve 
greatest weakness tendency lose confidence he¡¯d made blunder; let one goal became flustered therefore likely miss 
hand, harry seen ron make truly spectacular saves fonn; one memorable practice hung one-handed broom kicked quaffle hard away goal hoop soared length pitch center hoop end; rest team felt save compared favorably one made recently barry ryan, irish international keeper, poland¡¯s top chaser, ladislaw zamojski 
even fred said ron might yet make george proud, seriously considering admitting related them, something assured trying deny four years 
thing really worrying harry much ron allowing tactics slytherin team upset even got pitch 
harry, course, endured snide comments four years, whispers of, ¡°hey, potty, heard warrington¡¯s sworn knock broom saturday¡±, far chilling blood, made laugh 
¡°warrington¡¯s aim¡¯s pathetic i¡¯d worried aiming person next me,¡± retorted, made ron hennione laugh wiped smirk pansy parkinsons face 
ron never endured relentless campaign insults, jeers intimidation 
slytherins, seventh-years considerably larger was, muttered passed corridors, ¡°got bed booked hospital wing, weasley?¡± didn¡¯t laugh, turned delicate shade green 
draco malfoy imitated ron dropping quaffle (which whenever came within sight other), ron¡¯s ears glowed red hands shook badly likely drop whatever holding time, 
october extinguished rush howling winds driving rain november arrived, cold frozen iron, hard frosts every morning icy draughts bit exposed hands faces 
skies ceiling great hall turned pale, pearly grey, mountains around hogwarts snowcapped, temperature castle dropped low many students wore thick protective dragon skin gloves corridors lessons 
morning match dawned bright cold 
harry awoke looked round ron¡¯s bed saw sitting bolt upright, arms around knees, staring fixedly space 
¡°you right?¡± said harry 
ron nodded speak 
harry reminded forcibly time ron accidentally put slug-vomiting charm himself; looked pale sweaty done then, mention reluctant open mouth 
¡°you need breakfast,¡± harry said bracingly 
¡°c¡¯rnon 
¡± great hall filling fast arrived, talk louder mood exuberant usual 
passed slytherin table upsurge noise 
harry looked round saw that, addition usual green silver scarves hats, every one wearing silver badge shape seemed crown 
reason many waved ron, laughing uproariously 
harry tried see written badges walked by, concerned get ron past table quickly linger long enough read 
received rousing welcome gryffindor table, everyone wearing red gold, far raising ron¡¯s spirits cheers seemed sap last morale; collapsed nearest bench looking though facing final meal 
¡°i must¡¯ve mental this,¡± said croaky whisper 
¡°mental 
¡± ¡°don¡¯t thick,¡± said harry firmly, passing choice cereals, ¡°you¡¯re going fine 
it¡¯s nonnal nervous 
¡± ¡°i¡¯m rubbish,¡± croaked ron 
¡°i¡¯m lousy 
can¡¯t play save life 
thinking?¡± ¡°get grip,¡± said harry sternly 
¡°look save made foot day, even fred george said brilliant 
¡± ron turned tortured face harry 
¡°that accident,¡± whispered miserably 
¡°i didn¡¯t mean - 1 slipped broom none looking trying get back kicked quaffle accident 
¡± ¡°well,¡± said harry, recovering quickly unpleasant surprise, ¡°a accidents like game¡¯s bag, isn¡¯t it?¡± hennione ginny sat opposite wearing red gold scarves, gloves rosettes 
¡°how¡¯re feeling?¡± ginny asked ron, staring dregs milk bottom empty cereal bowl though seriously considering attempting drown 
¡°he¡¯s nervous,¡± said harry 
¡°well, that¡¯s good sign, never feel perform well exams you¡¯re bit nervous,¡± said hermione heartily 
¡°hello,¡± said vague dreamy voice behind 
harry looked up: luna lovegood drifted ravenclaw table 
many people staring openly laughing pointing; managed procure hat shaped like life-size lion¡¯s head, perched precariously head

certain amount apprehension harry, ron hermione headed hagrid¡¯s tuesday, heavily muffled cold 
harry worried, hagrid might decided teach them, also rest class, particularly malfoy cronies, would behave umbridge watching 
however, high inquisitor nowhere seen struggled snow towards hagrid, stood waiting edge forest 
present reassuring sight; bruises purple saturday night tinged green yellow cuts still seemed bleeding 
harry could understand this: hagrid perhaps attacked creature whose venom prevented wounds inflicted healing? though complete ominous picture, hagrid carrying looked like half dead cow shoulder 
¡°we¡¯re workin¡¯ today!¡± hagrid called happily approaching students, jerking head back dark trees behind 
¡°bit sheltered! anyway, prefer dark

wanted talk sirius, tell shouldn¡¯t listen word snape said, snape goading deliberately rest didn¡¯t think sirius coward dumbledore told remaining grimmauld place 
opportunity so, and, eyeing ugly look sirius¡¯s face, harry wondered occasionally whether would dared mention even chance

unfortunately, harry could see hagrid putting better show trelawney

¡°you think people take seriously he¡¯s published quibbler!¡± ¡°some people won¡¯t,¡± said hermione level voice

¡± rita looked though would liked nothing better seize paper umbrella sticking hermione¡¯s drink thrust nose 
¡°i don¡¯t suppose i¡¯ve got choice, i?¡± said rita, voice shaking slightly 
opened crocodile bag more, withdrew piece parchment, raised quick-quotes quill 
¡°daddy pleased,¡± said luna brightly 
muscle twitched rita¡¯s jaw 
¡°okay, harry?¡± said hermione, turning

¡°well, wouldn¡¯t easier she¡¯d asked whether liked better you?¡± ¡°girls don¡¯t often ask questions like that,¡± said hermione 
¡°well, should!¡± said harry forcefully

feeling rather depressed, looked back ron ginny 
¡°so, quidditch practice?¡± ¡°it nightmare,¡± said ron surly voice 
¡°oh come on,¡± said hennione, looking ginny, ¡°i¡¯m sure wasn¡¯t ¡°yes, was,¡± said ginny 
¡°it appalling 
angelina nearly tears end 
¡± ron ginny went baths dinner; harry hermione returned busy gryffindor common room usual pile homework 
harry struggling new star-chart astronomy half hour fred george turned 
¡°ron ginny here?¡± asked fred, looking around pulled chair, harry shook head, said, ¡°good

¡± ¡°maybe not,¡± said darkly, returning translation, ¡°but least happiness doesn¡¯t depend ron¡¯s goalkeeping ability 
¡± though harry would rather jumped astronomy tower admit her, time watched game following saturday would given number galleons care quidditch either 
best thing could say match short; gryffindor spectators endure twenty-two minutes agony 
hard say worst thing was: harry thought close-run contest ron¡¯s fourteenth failed save, sloper missing bludger hitting angelina mouth bat, kirke shrieking falling backwards broom zacharias smith zoomed carrying quaffle 
miracle gryffindor lost ten points: ginny managed snatch snitch right hufflepuff seeker summerby¡¯s nose, final score two hundred forty versus two hundred thirty 
¡°good catch,¡± harry told ginny back common room, atmosphere resembled particularly dismal funeral 
¡°i lucky,¡± shrugged

¡°why got letters, mr

¡°how dare

although slytherin narrowly defeated hufflepuff last match, gryffindor daring hope victory, due mainly (though course nobody said him) ron¡¯s abysmal goal-keeping record

trees ripped roots around mound, stood bare patch ground surrounded heaps trunks boughs formed kind fence barricade, behind harry, hennione hagrid stood 
¡°sleepin¡¯,¡± breathed hagrid 
sure enough, harry could hear distant, rhythmic rumbling sounded like pair enormous lungs work 
glanced sideways hennione, gazing mound mouth slightly open 
looked utterly tenified 
¡°hagrid,¡± said whisper barely audible sound sleeping creature, ¡°who he?¡± harry found odd question

¡± harry said nothing, turned look back gigantic form lying asleep ground front 
unlike hagrid, simply looked like oversized human, grawp looked strangely misshapen 
harry taken vast mossy boulder left great earthen mound recognized grawp ¡¯s head 
much larger proportion body human head, almost perfectly round covered tightly curling, close- growing hair color bracken 
rim single large, fleshy ear visible top head, seemed sit, rather like uncle vernon¡¯s, directly upon shoulders little neck 
back, looked like dirty brownish smock comprised animal skins sewn roughly together, broad; grawp slept, seemed strain little rough seams skins 
legs curled body 
harry could see soles enormous, filthy, bare feet, large sledges, resting one top earthy forest floor 
¡°you want us teach him,¡± harry said hollow voice 
understood firenze¡¯s warning meant 
attempt working 
would better abandon 
course, creatures lived forest would heard hagrids fruitless attempts teach grawp english 
¡°yeah - even yeh jus¡¯ talk ter bit,¡± said hagrid hopefully 
¡°cause reckon, talk ter people, he¡¯ll understand like ¡®im really, an¡¯ want ¡®im ter stay

¡°hagrid, no, don¡¯t wake him, really, don¡¯t need hagrid already stepped great tree trunk front proceeding towards grawp 
ten feet away, lifted long, broken bough ground, smiled reassuringly shoulder harry hennione, poked grawp hard middle back end bough 
giant gave roar echoed around silent forest; birds treetops overhead rose twittering perches soared away 
front harry hermione, meanwhile, gigantic grawp rising ground, shuddered placed enonnous hand upon push knees 
turned head see disturbed 
¡°all righ¡¯, grawpy?¡± said hagrid, would-be cheery voice, backing away long bough raised, ready poke grawp 
¡°had nice sleep, eh?¡± harry hermione retreated far could still keeping giant within sights 
grawp knelt two trees yet uprooted 
looked startlingly huge face resembled grey full moon swimming gloom clearing 
though features hewn great stone ball 
nose stubby shapeless, mouth lopsided full misshapen yellow teeth size half-bricks; eyes, small giant standards, muddy greenish-brown half-gummed together sleep 
grawp raised dirty knuckles, big cricket ball, eyes, rubbed vigorously, then, without warning, pushed feet surprising speed agility 
¡°oh my!¡± harry heard hermione squeal, terrified, beside 
trees ends ropes around grawp ¡¯s wrists ankles attached creaked ominously 
was, hagrid said, least sixteen feet tall 
gazing blearily around, grawp reached hand size beach umbrella, seized bird¡¯s nest upper branches towering pine turned upside-down roar apparent displeasure bird it; eggs fell like grenades towards ground hagrid threw arms head protect 
¡°anyway, grawpy,¡± shouted hagrid, looking apprehensively case falling eggs, ¡°i¡¯ve brought friends ter meet yeh 
remember, told yeh might? remember, said might ter go little trip an¡¯ leave ter look yeh fer bit? remember that, grawpy?¡± grawp merely gave another low roar; hard say whether listening hagrid whether even recognized sounds hagrid making speech 
seized top pine tree pulling towards him, evidently simple pleasure seeing far would spring back let go 
¡°now, grawpy, don¡¯ that!¡± shouted hagrid 
¡°tha¡¯s ended pullin¡¯ others sure enough, harry could see earth around tree¡¯s roots beginning crack 
¡°i got company yeh!¡± hagrid shouted 
¡°company, see! look down, yeh big buffoon, brought yeh friends!¡± ¡°oh, hagrid, don¡¯t,¡± moaned hennione, hagrid already raised bough gave grawp¡¯s knee sharp poke 
giant let go top tree, swayed alanningly deluged hagrid rain pine needles, looked 
¡°this,¡± said hagrid, hastening harry hennione stood, ¡°is harry, grawp! harry potter! migh¡¯ cornin¡¯ ter visit yeh ter go away, understand?¡± giant realized harry hennione 
watched, great trepidation, lowered huge boulder head could peer blearily 
¡°an¡¯ hennione, see? ¡ª ¡± hagrid hesitated 
turning hennione, said, ¡°would yeh mind called yeh hermy, hennione? on¡¯y it¡¯s difficult name fer ter remember 
¡± ¡°no, all,¡± squeaked hennione 
¡°this hermy, grawp! an¡¯ she¡¯s gonna cornin¡¯ an¡¯ all! is¡¯n¡¯ tha¡¯ nice? eh? two friends fer yeh ter - grawpy, ! ¡± grawp¡¯s hand shot nowhere towards hennione; harry seized pulled backwards behind tree, grawp¡¯s fist scraped trunk closed thin air 
¡°bad boy, grawpy!¡± heard hagrid yelling, hennione clung hany behind tree, shaking whimpering 
¡°very bad boy! yeh don¡¯ grab - ouch!¡± hany poked head around trunk saw hagrid lying back, hand nose 
grawp, apparently losing interest, straightened engaged pulling back pine far would go 
¡°righ¡¯,¡± said hagrid thickly, getting one hand pinching bleeding nose grasping crossbow, ¡°well 


yeh 


yeh¡¯ve met an¡¯ - an¡¯ he¡¯ll know yeh yeh come back 
yeah 


well 

looked grawp, pulling back pine expression detached pleasure boulderish face; roots creaking ripped away ground 
¡°well, reckon tha¡¯s enough fer one day,¡± said hagrid 
¡°we¡¯ll -er - we¡¯ll go back now, shall we?¡± harry hennione nodded 
hagrid shouldered crossbow and, still pinching nose, led way back trees 
nobody spoke while, even heard distant crash meant grawp pulled pine tree last 
hennione¡¯s face pale set 
harry could think single thing say 
earth going happen somebody found hagrid hidden grawp forbidden forest? promised he, ron hennione would continue hagrid¡¯s totally pointless attempts civilize giant 
could hagrid, even immense capacity delude fanged monsters loveably harmless, fool grawp would ever fit mix humans? ¡°hold it,¡± said hagrid abruptly, harry hennione struggling patch thick knotgrass behind 
pulled arrow quiver shoulder fitted crossbow 
harry hennione raised wands; stopped walking, they, too, could hear movement close 
¡°oh, blimey¡± said hagrid quietly 
¡°i thought told you, hagrid,¡± said deep male voice, ¡°that longer welcome here?¡± man¡¯s naked torso seemed instant floating towards dappled green half-light; saw waist joined smoothly horse¡¯s chestnut body 
centaur proud, high-cheekboned face long black hair 
like hagrid, anned; quiverful anows longbow slung shoulders 
¡°how yeh, magorian?¡± said hagrid warily 
trees behind centaur rustled four five centaurs emerged behind 
harry recognized black-bodied bearded bane, met nearly four years ago night met firenze 
bane gave sign ever seen harry 
¡°so,¡± said, nasty inflection voice, turning immediately magorian 
¡°we agreed, think, would human ever showed face forest again?¡± ¡®¡°this human¡¯ now, i?¡± said hagrid testily

¡°someone shut door,¡± harry muttered 
regretted giving order moment neville obeyed 
without long chink light torchlit corridor behind them, place became dark moment things could see bunches shivering blue flames walls ghostly reflections floor

harry felt familiar sensation hook jerked behind navel 
polished wooden floor gone beneath feet; atrium, fudge dumbledore disappeared flying forwards whirlwind color sound 


chapter thirty-seven lost prophecy harry¡¯s feet hit solid ground; knees buckled little golden wizard¡¯s head fell resounding dunk floor 
looked around saw arrived dumbledore¡¯s office 
everything seemed repaired headmaster¡¯s absence 
delicate silver instruments stood spindle-legged tables, puffing whirring serenely portraits headmasters headmistresses snoozing frames, heads lolling back armchairs edge picture 
harry looked window 
cool line pale green along horizon: dawn approaching 
silence stillness, broken occasional grunt snuffle sleeping portrait, unbearable 
surroundings could reflected feelings inside him, pictures would screaming pain 
walked around quiet, beautiful office, breathing quickly, trying think 
think

fault sirius died; fault 
he, harry, stupid enough fall voldemorf trick, convinced seen dream real, opened mind possibility voldemort was, hermione said, banking harry¡¯s love playing hero 


unbearable, would think it, could stand

¡°and brings early hours morning?¡± said phineas eventually ¡°this office supposed barred rightful headmaster

¡± gave another shuddering yawn 
¡°another message worthless great-great-grandson?¡± harry could speak 
phineas nigellus know sirius dead, harry could tell

harry nodded 
tugged doorknob behind back, remained immovable 
¡°oh good,¡± said wizard 
¡°it dull without him, dull indeed 
¡± settled throne-like chair painted smiled benignly upon harry ¡°dumbledore thinks highly you, sure know,¡± said comfortably 
¡°oh yes 
holds great esteem 
¡± guilt filling whole harry¡¯s chest like monstrous, weighty parasite, writhed squirmed 
harry could stand this, could stand 


never felt trapped inside head body, never wished intensely could somebody; anybody, else 


empty fireplace burst emerald green flame, making harry leap away door, staring man spinning inside grate 
dumbledore¡¯s tall form unfolded fire, wizards witches surrounding walls jerked awake, many giving cries welcome 
¡°thank you,¡± said dumbledore softly 
look harry first, walked perch beside door withdrew, inside pocket robes, tiny, ugly, featherless fawkes, placed gently tray soft ashes beneath golden post full-grown fawkes usually stood 
¡°well, harry,¡± said dumbledore, finally turning away baby bird, ¡°you pleased hear none fellow students going suffer lasting damage night¡¯s events 
¡± harry tried say, ¡°good,¡± sound came 
seemed dumbledore reminding amount damage caused, although dumbledore looking directly, although expression kindly rather accusatory, harry could bear meet eyes

¡°i know you¡¯re feeling, harry,¡± said dumbledore quietly 
¡°no, don¡¯t,¡± said harry, voice suddenly loud strong; white-hot anger leapt inside him; dumbledore knew nothing feelings 
¡°you see, dumbledore?¡± said phineas nigellus slyly ¡°never try understand students

would much rather tragically misunderstood, wallow self-pity, stew -¡± ¡°that¡¯s enough, phineas,¡± said dumbledore 
harry turned back dumbledore stared determinedly window

¡°you - standing - you¡± words longer enough, smashing things help; wanted run, wanted keep running never look back, wanted somewhere could see clear blue eyes staring him, hatefully calm old face 
turned heel ran door, seized doorknob wrenched 
door would open 
harry turned back dumbledore 
¡°let out,¡± said 
shaking head foot

seconds stared 
¡°let out,¡± harry said 
¡°no,¡± dumbledore repeated 
¡°if don¡¯t - keep - ¡®t let me¡± ¡°by means continue destroying possessions,¡± said dumbledore serenely 
¡°i daresay many

nevertheless, never believed instant necessity go department mysteries tonight 
open you, harry, been, would known long time ago voldemort might try lure department mysteries, would never tricked going tonight 
sirius would come 
blame lies me, alone 
¡± harry still standing hand doorknob unaware 
gazing dumbledore, hardly breathing, listening yet barely understanding hearing 
¡°please sit down,¡± said dumbledore 
order, request 
harry hesitated, walked slowly across room littered silver cogs fragments wood, took seat facing dumbledore¡¯s desk 
¡°am understand,¡± said phineas nigellus slowly harry¡¯s left, ¡°that great-great- grandson - last blacks - dead?¡± ¡°yes, phineas,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°i don¡¯t believe it,¡± said phineas brusquely 
harry turned head time see phineas marching portrait knew gone visit painting grimmauld place 
would walk, perhaps, portrait portrait, calling sirius house 


¡°harry, owe explanation,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°an explanation old man¡¯s mistakes 
see done, done, regard you, bears hallmarks failings age 
youth cannot know age thinks feels 
old men guilty forget young 


seem forgotten, lately 


¡± sun rising properly now; rim dazzling orange visible mountains sky colorless bright 
light fell upon dumbledore, upon silver eyebrows beard, upon lines gouged deeply face 
¡°i guessed, fifteen years ago,¡± said dumbledore, ¡°when saw scar forehead, might mean 
guessed might sign connection forged voldemort 
¡± ¡°you¡¯ve told before, professor,¡± said harry bluntly 
care rude 
care anything much 
¡°yes,¡± said dumbledore apologetically 
¡°yes, see - necessary start scar 
became apparent, shortly rejoined magical world, correct, scar giving warnings voldemort close you, else feeling powerful emotion 
¡± ¡°i know,¡± said harry wearily 
¡°and ability - detect voldemort¡¯s presence, even disguised, know feeling emotions roused - become pronounced since voldemort returned body full powers 
¡± harry bother nod 
knew already 
¡°more recently¡± said dumbledore, ¡°i became concerned voldemort might realize connection exists 
sure enough, came time entered far mind thoughts sensed presence 
speaking, course, night witnessed attack mr 
weasley¡± ¡°yeah, snape told me,¡± harry muttered 
¡°professor snape, harry¡± dumbledore corrected quietly 
¡°but wonder explained you? teach occlumency? much looked months?¡± harry looked 
could see dumbledore looked sad tired 
¡°yeah,¡± harry mumbled 
¡°yeah, wondered 
¡± ¡°you see,¡± dumbledore continued, ¡°i believed could long voldemort attempted force way mind, manipulate misdirect thoughts, eager give incentives 
sure realized relationship - ever - closer headmaster pupil, would seize chance use means spy 
feared uses would put you, possibility might try possess 
harry, believe right think voldemort would made use way 
rare occasions close contact, thought saw shadow stir behind eyes 


¡± harry remembered feeling dormant snake risen him, ready strike, moments dumbledore made eye-contact 
¡°voldemort¡¯s aim possessing you, demonstrated tonight, would destruction

¡°sirius told felt voldemort awake inside night vision arthur weasley¡¯s attack 
knew worst fears correct: voldemort realized could use

¡± paused 
harry watched sunlight, sliding slowly across polished surface dumbledore¡¯s desk, illuminate silver ink pot handsome scarlet quill 
harry could tell portraits around awake listening raptly dumbledore¡¯s explanation; could hear occasional rustle robes, slight clearing throat 
phineas nigellus still returned 


¡°professor snape discovered,¡± dumbledore resumed, ¡° dreaming door department mysteries months 
voldemort, course, obsessed possibility hearing prophecy ever since regained body; dwelled door, you, though know meant 
¡°and saw rockwood, worked department mysteries arrest, telling voldemort known along - prophecies held ministry magic heavily protected 
people refer lift shelves without suffering madness: case, either voldemort would enter ministry magic, risk revealing last - else would take 
became matter even greater urgency master occlumency¡± ¡°but didn¡¯t,¡± muttered harry 
said aloud try ease dead weight guilt inside him: confession must surely relieve terrible pressure squeezing heart 
¡°i didn¡¯t practice, didn¡¯t bother, could¡¯ve stopped dreams, hermione kept telling it, he¡¯d never able show go, - sirius wouldn¡¯t - sirius wouldn¡¯t¡± something erupting inside harry¡¯s head: need justify himself, explain - ¡°i tried check he¡¯d really taken sirius, went umbridge¡¯s office, spoke kreacher fire said sirius wasn¡¯t there, said he¡¯d gone!¡± ¡°kreacher lied,¡± said dumbledore calmly 
¡°you master, could lie without even needing punish 
kreacher intended go ministry magic 
¡± ¡°he - sent purpose?¡± ¡°oh yes 
kreacher, afraid, serving one master months 
¡± ¡°how?¡± said harry blankly 
¡°he hasn¡¯t grimmauld place years 
¡± ¡°kreacher seized opportunity shortly christmas,¡± said dumbledore, ¡°when sirius, apparently, shouted ¡®get out¡¯ 
took sirius word, interpreted order leave house 
went black family member respect left 


black¡¯s cousin narcissa, sister bellatrix wife lucius malfoy¡± ¡°how know this?¡± harry said 
heart beating fast 
felt sick 
remembered worrying kreacher¡¯ odd absence christmas, remembered turning attic 


¡°kreacher told last night,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°you see, gave professor snape cryptic warning, realized vision sirius trapped bowels department mysteries 
he, like you, attempted contact sirius 
explain members order phoenix reliable methods communicating fire dolores umbridge¡¯s office 
professor snape found sirius alive safe grimmauld place 
¡°when, however, return trip forest dolores umbridge, professor snape grew worried still believed sirius captive lord voldemort¡¯s 
alerted certain order members 
¡± dumbledore heaved great sigh continued, ¡°alastor moody, nymphadora tonks, kingsley shacklebolt remus lupin headquarters made contact 
agreed go aid 
professor snape requested sirius remain behind, needed somebody remain headquarters tell happened, due moment 
meantime he, professor snape, intended search forest 
¡°but sirius wish remain behind others went search 
delegated kreacher task telling happened 
arrived grimmauld place shortly left ministry, elf told - laughing fit burst - sirius gone 
¡± ¡°he laughing?¡± said harry hollow voice 
¡°oh, yes,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°you see, kreacher able betray us totally 
secret keeper order, could give malfoys whereabouts, tell order¡¯s confidential plans forbidden reveal 
bound enchantments kind, say could disobey direct order master, sirius 
gave narcissa information sort valuable voldemort, yet must seemed much trivial sirius think banning repeating 
¡± ¡°like what?¡± said harry 
¡°like fact person sirius cared world you,¡± said dumbledore quietly 
¡°like fact coming regard sirius mixture father brother 
voldemort knew already, course, sirius order, knew - kreacher¡¯s information made realize one person would go lengths rescue sirius black 
¡± harry¡¯s lips cold numb 
¡°so 


asked kreacher sirius last night 


¡± ¡°the malfoys - undoubtedly voldemort¡¯s instructions - told must find way keeping sirius way seen vision sirius tortured 
then, decided check whether sirius home not, kreacher would able pretend 
kreacher injured buckbeak hippogriff yesterday, and, moment made appearance fire, sirius upstairs tending 
¡± seemed little air harry¡¯s lungs; breathing quick shallow 
¡°and kreacher told 


laughed?¡± croaked 
¡°he wish tell me,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°but sufficiently accomplished legilimens know lied - persuaded - tell full story, left department mysteries 
¡± ¡°and,¡± whispered harry, hands curled cold fists knees, ¡°and hennione kept telling us nice him¡± ¡°she quite right, harry,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°i warned sirius adopted twelve grimmauld place headquarters kreacher must treated kindness respect 
also told kreacher could dangerous us 
think sinus took seriously, ever saw kreacher feelings acute human¡¯s¡± ¡°don¡¯t blame - don¡¯t - talk - sirius like harry¡¯s breath constricted, could get words properly; rage subsided briefly flared again: would let dumbledore criticize sirius 
¡°kreacher¡¯s lying - foul - deserved ¡°kreacher made wizards, harry¡± said dumbledore 
¡°yes, pitied 
existence miserable friend dobby¡¯s 
forced sirius¡¯s bidding, sirius last family enslaved, felt true loyalty 
whatever kreacher¡¯s faults, must admitted sirius nothing make kreacher¡¯s lot easier¡± ¡°don¡¯t talk sirius like that!¡± harry yelled 
feet again, furious, ready fly dumbledore, plainly understood sirius all, brave was, much suffered 


¡°what snape?¡± harry spat 
¡°you¡¯re talking him, you? told voldemort sirius sneered usual ¡°harry, know professor snape choice pretend take seriously front dolores umbridge,¡± said dumbledore steadily, ¡°but explained, infonned order soon possible said 
deduced gone return forest 
he, too, gave professor umbridge fake veritaserum attempting force tell sirius¡¯s whereabouts 
¡± harry disregarded this; felt savage pleasure blaming snape, seemed easing sense dreadful guilt, wanted hear dumbledore agree 
¡°snape - snape g - goaded sirius staying house - made sirius coward¡± ¡°sirius much old clever allowed feeble taunts hurt him,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°snape stopped giving occlumency lessons!¡± harry snarled 
¡°he threw office!¡± ¡°i aware it,¡± said dumbledore heavily ¡°i already said mistake teach myself, though sure, time, nothing could dangerous open mind even voldemort presence ¡ª ¡± ¡°snape made worse, scar always hurt worse lessons him¡± harry remembered ron¡¯s thoughts subject plunged know wasn¡¯t trying soften voldemort, make easier get inside ¡ª ¡± ¡°i trust severus snape,¡± said dumbledore simply ¡°but forgot - another old man¡¯s mistake - wounds run deep healing 
thought professor snape could overcome feelings father - 1 wrong 
¡± ¡°but that¡¯s okay, it?¡± yelled harry, ignoring scandalized faces disapproving mutterings portraits walls 
¡°it¡¯s okay snape hate dad, it¡¯s okay sirius hate kreacher?¡± ¡°sirius hate kreacher,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°he regarded servant unworthy much interest notice

¡°you might ask - good reason -

long time, neither spoke 
somewhere far beyond office walls, harry could hear sound voices, students heading great hall early breakfast, perhaps 
seemed impossible could people world still desired food, laughed, neither knew cared sirius black gone forever 
sirius seemed million miles away already; even part harry still believed pulled back veil, would found sirius looking back him, greeting him, perhaps, laugh like bark

¡± lowered voice whisper 
¡°he keeps saying umbridge best thing ever happened hogwarts 


¡± six looked around 
professor umbridge lying bed opposite them, gazing ceiling 
dumbledore strode alone forest rescue centaurs; done - emerged trees supporting professor umbridge without much scratch - nobody knew, umbridge certainly telling 
since returned castle not, far knew, uttered single word 
nobody really knew wrong her, either 
usually neat mousy hair untidy still bits twigs leaves it, otherwise seemed quite unscathed 
¡°madam pomfrey says she¡¯s shock,¡± whispered hennione 
¡°sulking, like,¡± said ginny ¡°yeah, shows signs life this,¡± said ron, tongue made soft clipclopping noises 
umbridge sat bolt upright, looking around wildly

¡°yeah, is,¡± said ron 
¡°still, least you-know-who never found either - going?¡± added, looking surprised disappointed harry stood 
¡°er - hagrid¡¯s,¡± said harry 
¡°you know, got back promised i¡¯d go see tell two 
¡± ¡°oh, right then,¡± said ron grumpily, looking dormitory window patch bright blue sky beyond 
¡°wish could come

¡°and ask what¡¯s happening 


little friend!¡± harry gave wave hand show heard understood left dormitory 
castle seemed quiet even sunday 
everybody clearly sunny grounds, enjoying end exams prospect last days term unhampered revision homework 
harry walked slowly along deserted corridor, peering windows went; could see people messing around air quidditch pitch couple students swimming lake, accompanied giant squid 
finding hard decide whether wanted people not; whenever company wanted get away whenever alone wanted company 
thought might really go visit hagrid, though, talked properly since he¡¯d returned 


harry descended last marble step entrance hall malfoy, crabbe goyle emerged door right harry knew led slytherin common room 
harry stopped dead; malfoy others 
sounds shouts, laughter splashes drifting hall grounds open front doors 
malfoy glanced around - harry knew checking signs teachers - looked back harry said low voice, ¡°you¡¯re dead, potter 
¡± harry raised eyebrows 
¡°funny¡± said, ¡°you¡¯d think i¡¯d stopped walking around 


¡± malfoy looked angrier harry ever seen him; felt kind detached satisfaction sight pale, pointed face contorted rage 
¡°you¡¯re going pay,¡± said malfoy voice barely louder whisper 
¡°i¡¯m going make pay you¡¯ve done father

¡°i s¡¯pose lord voldemort¡¯s warm-up act compared three - what¡¯s matter?¡± added, malfoy, crabbe goyle looked stricken sound name 
¡°he¡¯s dad¡¯s mate, isn¡¯t he? scared him, you?¡± ¡°you think you¡¯re big man, potter,¡± said malfoy, advancing now, crabbe goyle flanking

¡± ¡°yeah, expect will,¡± said harry ¡°still, least everyone knows scumbags now¡± malfoy ¡¯s hand flew towards wand, harry quick him; drawn wand malfoy¡¯s fingers even entered pocket robes 
¡°potter!¡± voice rang across entrance hall 
snape emerged staircase leading office sight harry felt great rush hatred beyond anything felt towards malfoy 


whatever dumbledore said, would never forgive snape 


never 


¡°what doing, potter?¡± said snape, coldly ever, strode four 
¡°i¡¯m trying decide curse use malfoy, sir,¡± said harry fiercely 
snape stared 
¡°put wand away once,¡± said curtly 
¡°ten points gryff-¡± snape looked towards giant hour-glasses walls gave sneering smile 
¡°ah 
see longer points left gryffindor hour-glass take away 
case, potter, simply -¡± ¡°add more?¡± professor mcgonagall stumped stone steps castle; carrying tartan carpetbag one hand leaning heavily walking stick other, otherwise looked quite well 
¡°professor mcgonagall!¡± said snape, striding forwards 
¡°out st

two - crabbe - goyle¡± beckoned forwards imperiously came, shuffling large feet looking awkward 
¡°here,¡± said professor mcgonagall, thrusting carpetbag crabbe ¡¯s chest cloak goyle¡¯s; ¡°take office 
¡± turned stumped away marble staircase 
¡°right then,¡± said professor mcgonagall, looking hourglasses wall 
¡°well, think potter friends ought fifty points apiece alerting world return you-know-who! say you, professor snape?¡± ¡°what?¡± snapped snape, though harry knew heard perfectly well 
¡°oh - well - 1 suppose 


¡± ¡°so that¡¯s fifty potter, two weasleys, longbottom miss granger,¡± said professor mcgonagall, shower rubies fell bottom bulb gryffindor¡¯ hour-glass spoke 
¡°oh - fifty miss lovegood, suppose,¡± added, number sapphires fell ravenclaw¡¯s glass 
¡°now, wanted take ten mr 
potter, think, professor snape - 


¡± rubies retreated upper bulb, leaving respectable amount nevertheless 
¡°well, potter, malfoy think ought outside glorious day like this,¡± professor mcgonagall continued briskly 
harry need telling twice- thrust wand back inside robes headed straight front doors without another glance snape malfoy 
hot sun hit blast walked across lawns towards hagrid¡¯s cabin 
students lying around grass sunbathing, talking, reading sunday prophet eating sweets, looked passed; called him, else waved, clearly eager show they, like prophet, decided something hero 
harry said nothing 
idea much knew happened three days ago, far avoided questioned preferred keep way 
thought first knocked hagrid¡¯s cabin door out, fang came charging around corner almost bowled enthusiasm welcome 
hagrid, transpired, picking runner beans back garden 
¡°all righ¡¯, harry!¡± said, beaming, harry approached fence 
¡°come in, come in, we¡¯ll cup o¡¯ dandelion juice 


¡± ¡°how¡¯s things?¡± hagrid asked him, settled wooden table glass apiece iced juice 
¡°yeh - er - feelin¡¯ righ¡¯, yeh?¡± harry knew look concern hagrid¡¯s face referring harry¡¯s physical well-being 
¡°i¡¯m fine,¡± harry said quickly, could bear discuss thing knew hagrid¡¯s mind 
¡°so, where¡¯re been?¡± ¡°bin hidin¡¯ mountains,¡± said hagrid 
¡°up cave, like sirius ¡ª ¡± hagrid broke off, cleared throat gruffly, looked harry, took long draught juice 
¡°anyway, back now,¡± said feebly 
¡°you - look better,¡± said harry, detennined keep conversation moving away sirius 
¡°wha¡¯?¡± said hagrid, raising massive hand feeling face 
¡°oh - oh yeah 
well, grawpy¡¯s loads better behaved now, loads 
seemed right pleased ter see got back, ter tell yeh truth 
he¡¯s good lad, really 


i¡¯ve bin thinkin¡¯ abou¡¯ tryin¡¯ ter find lady friend, actually 


¡± harry would normally tried persuade hagrid idea once; prospect second giant taking residence forest, possibly even wilder brutal grawp, positively alarming, somehow harry could muster energy necessary argue point 
starting wish alone again, idea hastening departure took several large gulps dandelion juice, half-emptying glass 
¡°ev¡¯ryone kn ows yeh¡¯ve bin fellin¡¯ truth now, harry,¡± said hagrid softly unexpectedly 
watching harry closely 
¡°tha¡¯s gotta better, hasn¡¯ it?¡± harry shrugged 
¡°look 

hagrid leaned towards across table, ¡°i knew sirius longer ¡®n yeh 


died battle, an¡¯ tha¡¯s way he¡¯d¡¯ve wanted ter go ¡°he didn¡¯t want go all!¡± said harry angrily 
hagrid bowed great shaggy head 


¡°nah, don¡¯ reckon did,¡± said quietly 
¡°but till, harry 


never one ter sit aroun¡¯ home an¡¯ let people fightin¡¯ 
couldn¡¯ve lived hadn¡¯ gone ter help harry leapt 
¡°i¡¯ve got go visit ron hermione hospital wing,¡± said mechanically 
¡°oh,¡± said hagrid, looking rather upset 
¡°oh 


righ¡¯ then, harry 


take care o¡¯ yerself then, an¡¯ drop back yeh¡¯ve got ¡°yeah 


right 


¡± harry crossed door fast could pulled open; sunshine hagrid finished saying goodbye, walking away across lawn 
again, people called passed 
closed eyes moments, wishing would vanish, could open eyes find alone grounds 


days ago, exams finished seen vision voldemort planted mind, would given almost anything wizarding world know telling truth, believe voldemort back, know neither liar mad 
now, however 


walked short way around lake, sat bank, sheltered gaze passersby behind tangle shrubs, stared gleaming water, thinking 


perhaps reason wanted alone felt isolated everybody since talk dumbledore 
invisible barrier separated rest world 
- always - marked man 
never really understood meant 


yet sitting edge lake, terrible weight grief dragging him, loss sirius raw fresh inside, could muster great sense fear 
sunny, grounds around full laughing people, even though felt distant though belonged different race, still hard believe sat life must include, end in, murder 


sat long time, gazing water, trying think godfather remember directly across here, opposite bank, sirius collapsed trying fend hundred dementors 


sun set realized cold 
got returned castle, wiping face sleeve went 
ron hennione left hospital wing completely cured three days end term 
hermione kept showing signs wanting talk sirius, ron tended make 'hushing noises every time mentioned name 
harry still sure whether wanted talk godfather yet; wishes varied mood 
knew one thing, though: unhappy felt moment, would greatly miss hogwarts days¡¯ time back number four, privet drive 
even though understood exactly return every summer, feel better 
indeed, never dreaded return 
professor umbridge left hogwarts day end term 
seemed crept hospital wing dinnertime, evidently hoping depart undetected, unfortunately her, met peeves way, seized last chance fred instructed, chased gleefully premises whacking alternately walking stick sock full chalk 
many students ran entrance hall watch running away path heads houses tried half-heartedly restrain 
indeed, professor mcgonagall sank back chair staff table feeble remonstrances clearly heard express regret could run cheering umbridge herself, peeves borrowed walking stick 
last evening school arrived; people finished packing already heading end-of-tenn feast, harry even started 
¡°just tomorrow!¡± said ron, waiting door donnitory 
¡°come on, i¡¯m starving 
¡± ¡°i won¡¯t long 


look, go ahead 


¡± donnitory door closed behind ron, harry made effort speed packing 
last thing wanted attend leaving feast 
worried dumbledore would make reference speech 
sure mention voldemort¡¯s return; talked last year, 


harry pulled crumpled robes bottom trunk make way folded ones and, so, noticed badly wrapped package lying corner 
could think 
bent down, pulled underneath trainers examined 
realized within seconds 
sirius given inside front door number twelve grimmauld place 
¡®use need me, right?¡¯ harry sank bed unwrapped package 
fell small, square mirror 
looked old; certainly dirty 
harry held face saw reflection looking back 
turned mirror 
reverse side scribbled note sirius 
two-way mirror, i¡¯ve got 
need speak me, say name it; ¡¯ll appear mirror i'll able talk 
james used use separate detentions 
harry¡¯s heart began race 
remembered seeing dead parents mirror erised four years ago 
going able talk sirius again, right now, knew - looked around make sure nobody else there; dormitory quite empty 
looked back mirror, raised front face trembling hands said, loudly clearly, ¡°sirius 
¡± breath misted surface glass 
held mirror even closer, excitement flooding him, eyes blinking back fog definitely 
wiped mirror clear said, every syllable rang clearly room: ¡°sirius black!¡± nothing happened 
frustrated face looking back mirror still, definitely, 


sirius didn¡¯t mirror went archway, said small voice harry¡¯s head 
that¡¯s it¡¯s working 


harry remained quite still moment, hurled mirror back trunk shattered 
convinced, whole, shining minute, going see sirius, talk 


disappointment burning throat; got began throwing things pell-mell trunk top broken mirror - idea struck 


better idea mirror 


much bigger, important idea 


never thought - never asked? sprinting dormitory spiral staircase hitting walls ran barely noticing; hurtled across empty common room, portrait hole along corridor, ignoring fat lady, called him: ¡°the feast start, know, you¡¯re cutting fine!¡± harry intention going feast 


could place full ghosts whenever didn¡¯t need one, yet 


ran staircases along corridors met nobody either alive dead 
all, clearly, great hall 
outside channs classroom came halt, panting thinking disconsolately would wait later, end feast 


given hope, saw - translucent somebody drifting across end corridor 
¡°hey -hey nick! nick!¡± ghost stuck head back wall, revealing extravagantly plumed hat dangerously wobbling head sir nicholas de mimsy-porpington 
¡°good evening,¡± said, withdrawing rest body solid stone smiling harry ¡°i one late, then? though,¡± sighed, ¡°in rather different sense, course 


¡± ¡°nick, ask something?¡± peculiar expression stole nearly headless nick¡¯s face inserted finger stiff ruff neck tugged little straighter, apparently give thinking time 
desisted partially severed neck seemed give way completely 
¡°er - now, harry?¡± said nick, looking discomfited 
¡°can¡¯t wait feast?¡± ¡°no - nick - please,¡± said harry, ¡°i really need talk 
go here?¡± harry opened door nearest classroom nearly headless nick sighed 
¡°oh, well,¡± said, looking resigned 
¡°i can¡¯t pretend haven¡¯t expecting 
¡± harry holding door open him, drifted wall instead 
¡°expecting what?¡± harry asked, closed door 
¡°you come find me,¡± said nick, gliding window looking darkening grounds 
¡°it happens, sometimes 


somebody suffered 


loss 
¡± ¡°well,¡± said harry, refusing deflected 
¡°you right, i¡¯ve - i¡¯ve come find 
¡± nick said nothing 
¡°it¡¯s said harry, finding awkward anticipated, ¡°it¡¯s - you¡¯re dead 
you¡¯re still here, aren¡¯t you?¡± nick sighed continued gaze grounds 
¡°that¡¯s right, isn¡¯t it?¡± harry urged 
¡°you died, i¡¯m talking 


walk around hogwarts everything, can¡¯t you?¡± ¡°yes,¡± said nearly headless nick quietly, ¡°i walk talk, yes 
¡± ¡°so, came back, didn¡¯t you?¡± said harry urgently 
¡°people come back, right? ghosts 
don¡¯t disappear completely 
well?¡± added impatiently, nick continued say nothing 
nearly headless nick hesitated, said, ¡°not everyone come back ghost 
¡± ¡°what d¡¯you mean?¡± said harry quickly ¡°only 


wizards 
¡± ¡°oh,¡± said harry, almost laughed relief 
¡°well, that¡¯s okay then, person i¡¯m asking wizard 
come back, right?¡± nick turned away window looked mournfully harry 
¡°he won¡¯t come back 
¡± ¡°who?¡± ¡°sirius black,¡± said nick 
¡°but did!¡± said harry angrily 
¡°you came back - you¡¯re dead didn¡¯t disappear ¡°wizards leave imprint upon earth, walk palely living selves trod,¡± said nick miserably 
¡°but wizards choose path 
¡± ¡°why not?¡± said harry 
¡°anyway - doesn¡¯t matter - sirius won¡¯t care it¡¯s unusual, he¡¯ll come back, know will!¡± strong belief, harry actually turned head check door, sure, split second, going see sirius, pearly-white transparent beaming, walking towards 
¡°he come back,¡± repeated nick 
¡°he 


gone 
¡± ¡°what d¡¯you mean, ¡®gone on¡¯?¡± said harry quickly ¡°gone where? listen - happens die, anyway? go? doesn¡¯t everyone come back? isn¡¯t place full ghosts? -?¡± ¡°i cannot answer,¡± said nick 
¡°you¡¯re dead, aren¡¯t you?¡± said harry exasperatedly 
¡°who answer better you?¡± ¡°i afraid death,¡± said nick softly 
¡°i chose remain behind 
sometimes wonder whether oughtn¡¯t 


well, neither 


fact, neither 


¡± gave small sad chuckle 
¡°i know nothing secrets death, harry, chose feeble imitation life instead 
believe learned wizards study matter department mysteries ¡°don¡¯t talk place!¡± said harry fiercely 
¡°i sorry help,¡± said nick gently ¡°well 


well, excuse 


feast, know 


¡± left room, leaving harry alone, gazing blankly wall nick disappeared 
harry felt almost though lost godfather losing hope might able see speak 
walked slowly miserably back empty castle, wondering whether would ever feel cheerful 
turned corner towards fat lady¡¯s corridor saw somebody ahead fastening note board wall 
second glance showed luna 
good hiding places nearby, bound heard footsteps, case, harry could hardly muster energy avoid anyone moment 
¡°hello,¡± said luna vaguely, glancing around stepped back notice 
¡°how come you¡¯re feast?¡± harry asked 
¡°well, i¡¯ve lost possessions,¡± said luna serenely 
¡°people take hide them, know 
it¡¯s last night, really need back, i¡¯ve putting signs 
¡± gestured towards noticeboard, upon which, sure enough, pinned list missing books clothes, plea return 
odd feeling rose harry; emotion quite different anger grief filled since sirius¡¯s death 
moments realized feeling sorry luna 
¡°how come people hide stuff?¡± asked her, frowning 
¡°oh 


well 


¡± shrugged 
¡°i think think i¡¯m bit odd, know 
people call ¡®loony¡¯ lovegood, actually 
¡± harry looked new feeling pity intensified rather painfully 
¡°that¡¯s reason take things,¡± said flatly 
¡°d¡¯you want help finding them?¡± ¡°oh, no,¡± said, smiling 
¡°they¡¯ll come back, always end 
wanted pack tonight 
anyway 


aren¡¯t feast?¡± harry shrugged 
¡°just didn¡¯t feel like 
¡± ¡°no,¡± said luna, observing oddly misty, protuberant eyes 
¡°i don¡¯t suppose 
man death eaters killed godfather, wasn¡¯t he? ginny told 
¡± harry nodded curtly, found reason mind luna talking sirius 
remembered she, too, could see thestrals 
¡°have 


¡± began 
¡°i mean, 


anyone known ever died?¡± ¡°yes,¡± said luna simply, ¡°my mother 
quite extraordinary witch, know, like experiment one spells went rather badly wrong one day 
nine 
¡± ¡°i¡¯m sorry¡± harry mumbled 
¡°yes, rather horrible,¡± said luna conversationally 
¡°i still feel sad sometimes 
i¡¯ve still got dad 
anyway, it¡¯s though i¡¯ll never see mum again, it?¡± ¡°er - isn¡¯t it?¡± said harry uncertainly 
shook head disbelief 
¡°oh, come 
heard them, behind veil, didn¡¯t you?¡± ¡°you mean 


¡± ¡°in room archway 
lurking sight, that¡¯s 
heard 
¡± looked 
luna smiling slightly 
harry know say, think; luna believed many extraordinary things 


yet sure heard voices behind veil, 
¡°are sure don¡¯t want help look stuff?¡± said 
¡°oh, no,¡± said luna 
¡°no, thi nk i¡¯ll go pudding wait turn 


always end 


well, nice holiday harry¡± ¡°yeah 


yeah, 
¡± walked away and, watched go, found terrible weight stomach- seemed lessened slightly 
journey home hogwarts express next day eventful several ways 
firstly malfoy, crabbe goyle, clearly waiting week opportunity strike without teacher witnesses, attempted ambush harry halfway train made way back toilet 
attack might succeeded fact unwittingly chose stage attack right outside compartment full

¡°i must say, i¡¯m looking forward seeing malfoy¡¯s mother¡¯s face gets train,¡± said ernie, satisfaction, watched malfoy squirm 
ernie never quite got indignity malfoy docking points hufflepuff brief spell member inquisitorial squad 
¡°goyle¡¯s mum¡¯ll really pleased, though,¡± said ron, come investigate source commotion 
¡°he¡¯s loads better looking

hermione reading daily prophet again, ginny quiz quibbler neville stroking mimbulus mimbletonia, grown great deal year made odd crooning noises touched 
harry ron whiled away journey playing wizard chess hennione read snippets prophet 
full articles repel dementors, attempts ministry track death eaters hysterical letters claiming writer seen lord voldemort walking past house morning 


¡°it hasn¡¯t really started yet,¡± sighed hennione gloomily, folding newspaper 
¡°but won¡¯t long 


¡± ¡°hey, harry¡± said ron softly, nodding towards glass window corridor 
harry looked around 
cho passing, accompanied marietta edgecombe, wearing balaclava 
cho¡¯s eyes met moment 
cho blushed kept walking 
harry looked back chessboard time see one pawns chased square ron¡¯s knight 
¡°what¡¯s - er - going her, anyway?¡± ron asked quietly ¡°nothing,¡± said harry truthfully 
¡°i - er - heard she¡¯s going someone else now,¡± said hennione tentatively 
harry surprised find infonnation hurt 
wanting impress cho seemed belong past longer quite connected him; much wanted sirius¡¯, death felt way days 


week elapsed since last seen sirius seemed lasted much, much longer; stretched across two universes, one sirius it, one without 
¡°you¡¯re well it, mate,¡± said ron forcefully 
¡°i mean, she¡¯s quite good-looking that, want someone bit cheerful 
¡± ¡°she¡¯s probably cheerful enough someone else,¡± said harry, shrugging 
¡°who¡¯s now, anyway?¡± ron asked hennione, ginny answered 
¡°michael corner,¡± said 
¡°michael - ¡ª ¡± said ron, craning around hiss eat stare 
¡°but going him!¡± ¡°not more,¡± said ginny resolutely 
¡°he didn¡¯t like gryffindor beating ravenclaw quidditch, got really sulky, ditched ran comfort cho instead

ron looked highly delighted 
¡°well, always thought bit idiot,¡± said, prodding queen forwards towards harry¡¯s quivering castle 
¡°good 
choose someone - better - next time 
¡± cast harry oddly furtive look said 
¡°well, i¡¯ve chosen dean thomas, would say he¡¯s better?¡± asked ginny vaguely

chapter one minister nearing midnight prime minister sitting alone office, reading long memo slipping brain without leaving slightest trace meaning behind 
waiting call president far distant country, wondering wretched man would telephone, trying suppress unpleasant memories long, tiring, difficult week, much space head anything else 
attempted focus print page him, clearly prime minister could see gloating face one political opponents 
particular opponent appeared news day, enumerate terrible things happened last week (as though anyone needed reminding) also explain every one government¡¯s fault 
prime minister¡¯s pulse quickened thought accusations, neither fair true 
earth government supposed stopped bridge collapsing? outrageous anybody suggest spending enough bridges 
bridge fewer ten years old, best experts loss explain snapped cleanly two, sending dozen cars watery depths river 
dare anyone suggest lack policemen resulted two nasty well-publicized murders? government somehow foreseen freak hurricane west country caused much damage people property? fault one junior ministers, herbert chorley, chosen week act peculiarly going spending lot time family? ¡°a grim mood gripped country,¡± opponent concluded, barely concealing broad grin 
unfortunately, perfectly true 
prime minister felt himself; people really seem miserable usual 
even weather dismal; chilly mist middle july 


wasn¡¯t right, wasn¡¯t normal 


turned second page memo, saw much longer went on, gave bad job 
stretching arms head looked around office mournfully 
handsome room, fine marble fireplace facing long sash windows, firmly closed unseasonable chill 
slight shiver, prime minister got moved window, looking thin mist pressing glass 
then, stood back room, heard soft cough behind 
froze, nose nose scared-looking reflection dark glass 
knew cough

turned slowly face empty room 
¡°hello?¡± said, trying sound braver felt 
brief moment allowed impossible hope nobody would answer 
however, voice responded once, crisp, decisive voice sounded though reading prepared statement

¡°yes, i¡¯ll see fudge 
¡± hurried back desk, straightening tie went 
barely resumed seat, arranged face hoped relaxed unfazed expression, bright green flames burst life empty grate beneath marble mantelpiece 
watched, trying betray flicker surprise alarm, portly man appeared within flames, spinning fast top 
seconds later, climbed onto rather fine antique rug, brushing ash sleeves long pin-striped cloak, lime-green bowler hat hand 
¡°ah 


prime minister,¡± said cornelius fudge, striding forward hand outstretched 
¡°good see 
¡± prime minister could honestly return compliment, said nothing 
remotely pleased see fudge, whose occasional appearances, apart downright alarming themselves, generally meant hear bad news 
furthermore, fudge looking distinctly careworn 
thinner, balder, grayer, face crumpled look 
prime minister seen kind look politicians before, never boded well 
¡°how help you?¡± said, shaking fudge¡¯s hand briefly gesturing toward hardest chairs front desk 
¡°difficult know begin,¡± muttered fudge, pulling chair, sitting down, placing green bowler upon knees 
¡°what week, week

¡°yes, course,¡± said fudge, rubbing eyes wearily looking morosely prime minister

¡± hesitated prime minister 
precisely sort behavior made dislike fudge¡¯s visits much 
was, all, prime minister appreciate made feel like ignorant schoolboy 
course, like first meeting fudge first evening prime minister 
remembered though yesterday knew would haunt dying day 
standing alone office, savoring triumph many years dreaming scheming, heard cough behind him, like tonight, turned find ugly little portrait talking him, announcing minister magic arrive introduce naturally, thought long campaign strain election caused go mad 
utterly terrified find portrait talking him, though nothing felt self-proclaimed wizard bounced fireplace shaken hand 
remained speechless throughout fudge¡¯s kindly explanation witches wizards still living secret world reassurances bother head ministry magic took responsibility whole wizarding community prevented non-magical population getting wind 
was, said fudge, difficult job encompassed everything regulations responsible use broomsticks keeping dragon population control (the prime minister remembered clutching desk support point) 
fudge patted shoulder still- dumbstruck prime minister fatherly sort way 
¡°not worry,¡± said, ¡°it¡¯s odds-on you¡¯ll never see 
i¡¯ll bother there¡¯s something really serious going end, something that¡¯s likely affect muggles ¡ª non-magical population, say 
otherwise, it¡¯s live let live 
must say, you¡¯re taking lot better predecessor 
tried throw window, thought hoax planned opposition 
¡± this, prime minister found voice last 
¡°you¡¯re ¡ª you¡¯re hoax, then?¡± last, desperate hope 
¡°no,¡± said fudge gently 
¡°no, i¡¯m afraid i¡¯m

¡°we find best way maintain secrecy 
¡± ¡°but then,¡± bleated prime minister, ¡°why hasn¡¯t former prime minister warned ¡ª ?¡± this, fudge actually laughed 
¡°my dear prime minister, ever going tell anybody?¡± still chortling, fudge thrown powder fireplace, stepped emerald flames, vanished whooshing sound 
prime minister stood there, quite motionless, realized would never, long lived, dare mention encounter living soul, wide world would believe him? shock taken little wear 
time, tried convince fudge indeed hallucination brought lack sleep grueling election campaign 
vain attempt rid reminders uncomfortable encounter, given gerbil delighted niece instructed private secretary take portrait ugly little man announced fudge¡¯s arrival 
prime minister¡¯s dismay, however, portrait proved impossible remove 
several carpenters, builder two, art historian, chancellor exchequer tried unsuccessfully pry wall, prime minister abandoned attempt simply resolved hope thing remained motionless silent rest term office 
occasionally could sworn saw comer eye occupant painting yawning, else scratching nose; even, twice, simply walking frame leaving nothing stretch muddy-brown canvas behind 
however, trained look picture much, always tell firmly eyes playing tricks anything like happened 
then, three years ago, night like tonight, prime minister alone office portrait announced imminent arrival fudge, burst fireplace, sopping wet state considerable panic 
prime minister could ask dripping axminster, fudge started ranting prison prime minister never heard of, man named ¡°serious¡± black, something sounded like ¡°hogwarts,¡± boy called harry potter, none made remotest sense prime minister

¡± prime minister rather resented told sit office, let alone offered whiskey, sat nevertheless 
fudge pulled wand, conjured two large glasses full amber liquid thin air, pushed one prime minister¡¯s hand, drew chair

¡°a mass breakout?¡± repeated prime minister hoarsely 
¡°no need worry, need worry!¡± shouted fudge, already one foot flames 
¡°we¡¯ll rounded time ¡ª thought ought know!¡± prime minister could shout, ¡°now, wait one moment!¡± fudge vanished shower green sparks 
whatever press opposition might say, prime minister foolish man 
escaped notice that, despite fudge¡¯s assurances first meeting, seeing rather lot other, fudge becoming flustered visit 
little though liked think minister magic (or, always called fudge head, minister), prime minister could help fear next time fudge appeared would graver news still 
site, therefore, fudge stepping fire more, looking disheveled fretful sternly surprised prime minister know exactly there, worst thing happened course extremely gloomy week 
¡°how know what¡¯s going ¡ª er ¡ª wizarding community?¡± snapped prime minister

prime minister surreptitiously touched wood desk, fudge continued, ¡°but blacks by-the-by

¡°i hope forgive mentioning it, harry, pleased little proud well seem coping everything happened ministry

malfoy wanted hide pansy? see mysterious broken object important mend? ¡°petrificus totalus!¡± without warning, malfoy pointed wand harry, instantly paralyzed 
though slow motion, toppled luggage rack fell, agonizing, floor-shaking crash, malfoy¡¯ feet, invisibility cloak trapped beneath him, whole body revealed legs still curled absurdly cramped kneeling position 
couldn¡¯t move muscle; could gaze malfoy, smiled broadly 
¡°i thought so,¡± said jubilantly

lay beneath invisibility cloak feeling blood nose flow, hot wet, face, listening voices footsteps corridor beyond 
immediate thought someone would, surely check compartments train departed 
came dispiriting realization even somebody looked compartment, would neither seen heard 
best hope somebody else would walk step 
harry never hated malfoy lay there, like absurd turtle back, blood dripping sickeningly open mouth 
stupid situation landed 


last footsteps dying away; everyone shuffling along dark platform outside; could hear scraping trunks loud babble talk 
ron hermione would think left train without 
arrived hogwarts took places great hall, looked gryffindor table times, finally realized there, he, doubt, would halfway back london 
tried make sound, even grunt, impossible 
remembered wizards, like dumbledore, could perform spells without speaking, tried summon wand, fallen hand, saying words ¡°accio wand!¡± head, nothing happened 
thought could hear rustling trees surrounded lake, far-off hoot owl, hint search made even (he despised slightly hoping it) panicked voices wondering harry potter gone 
feeling hopelessness spread imagined convoy thestral-drawn carriages trundling school muffled yells laughter issuing whichever carriage malfoy riding in, could recounting attack harry crabbe, goyle, zabini, pansy parkinson

¡°we¡¯d better get here, quickly,¡± said, train windows became obscured steam began move station 
¡°come on, we¡¯ll jump

tonks looking him; felt angry embarrassed discovered ridiculous position 
silently handed back invisibility cloak 
¡°who it?¡± ¡°draco malfoy,¡± said harry bitterly 
¡°thanks

¡± ¡°no problem,¡± said tonks, without smiling 
harry could see darkness, mousy-haired miserable-looking met burrow 
¡°i fix nose stand still

harry¡¯s nose felt hot, cold 
raised hand felt gingerly 
seemed mended 
¡°thanks lot!¡± ¡°you¡¯d better put cloak back on, walk school,¡± said tonks, still unsmiling 
harry swung cloak back himself, waved wand; immense silvery four-legged creature erupted streaked darkness 
¡°was patronus?¡± asked harry, seen dumbledore send messages like 
¡°yes, i¡¯m sending word castle i¡¯ve got they¡¯ll worry 
come on, we¡¯d better dawdle

¡°is who¡¯s stationed here, ¡ª ?¡± ¡°no, proudfoot, savage, dawlish 
¡± ¡°dawlish, auror dumbledore attacked last year?¡± ¡°that¡¯s right 
¡± trudged dark, deserted lane, following freshly made carriage tracks 
harry looked sideways tonks cloak 
last year inquisitive (to point little annoying times), laughed easily, made jokes 
seemed older much serious purposeful 
effect happened ministry? reflected uncomfortably hennione would suggested say something consoling sirius her, hadn¡¯t fault all, couldn¡¯t bring 
far blaming sirius¡¯s death; fault anyone else¡¯s (and much less his), like talking sirius could avoid 
tramped cold night silence, tonks ¡¯s long cloak whispering ground behind 
always traveled carriage, harry never appreciated far hogwarts hogsmeade station 
great relief finally saw tall pillars either side gates, topped winged boar 
cold, hungry quite keen leave new, gloomy tonks behind 
put hand push open gates, found chained shut 
¡°alohomora!¡± said confidently, pointing wand padlock, nothing happened 
¡°that won¡¯t work these,¡± said tonks 
¡°dumbledore bewitched

harry pleased see felt could even endure filch¡¯ wheezy criticisms tardiness rants timekeeping would improve regular application thumbscrews 
glowing yellow light ten feet away them, pulled invisibility cloak could seen, recognized, rush pure loathing, uplit hooked nose long, black, greasy hair severus snape 
¡°well, well, well,¡± sneered snape, taking wand tapping padlock once, chains snaked backward gates creaked open 
¡°nice turn up, potter, although evidently decided wearing school robes would detract appearance 
¡± ¡°i couldn¡¯t change, didn¡¯t ¡ª ¡± harry began, snape cut across 
¡°there need wait, nymphadora, potter quite ¡ª ah ¡ª safe hands

¡°hagrid late start-of-term feast, like potter here, took instead

¡± shut gates face loud clang tapped chains wand again, slithered, clinking, back place 
¡°i think better old one,¡± said snape, malice voice unmistakable 
¡°the new one looks weak 
¡± snape swung lantern about, harry saw, fleetingly, look shock anger tonks ¡¯s face 
covered darkness 
¡°good night,¡± harry called shoulder, began walk school snape 
¡°thanks 


everything,¡± ¡°see you, harry 
¡± snape speak minute 
harry felt though body generating waves hatred powerful seemed incredible snape could feel burning 
loathed snape first encounter, snape placed forever irrevocably beyond possibility harry¡¯s forgiveness attitude toward sirius 
whatever dumbledore said, harry time think summer, concluded snape ¡¯s snide remarks sirius remaining safely hidden rest order phoenix fighting voldemort probably powerful factor sirius rushing ministry night died 
harry clung notion, enabled blame snape, felt satisfying, also knew anyone sorry sirius dead, man striding next darkness 
¡°fifty points gryffindor lateness, think,¡± said snape 
¡°and, let see, another twenty muggle attire 
know, don¡¯t believe house ever negative figures early term: haven¡¯t even started pudding 
might set record, potter 
¡± fury hatred bubbling inside harry seemed blaze white-hot, would rather immobilized way back london tell snape late 
¡°i suppose wanted make entrance, you?¡± snape continued 
¡°and flying car available decided bursting great hall halfway feast ought create dramatic effect 
¡± still harry remained silent, though thought chest might explode 
knew snape come fetch this, minutes could needle torment harry without anyone else listening 
reached castle steps last great oaken front doors swung open vast flagged entrance hall, burst talk laughter tinkling plates glasses greeted doors standing open great hail 
harry wondered whether could slip invisibility cloak back on, thereby gaining seat long gryffindor table (which, inconveniently, farthest entrance hall) without noticed 
though read harry¡¯s mind, however, snape said, ¡°no cloak 
walk everyone sees you, wanted, i¡¯m sure 
¡± harry turned spot marched straight open doors: anything get away snape 
great hall four long house tables staff table set top room decorated usual floating candles made plates glitter glow

¡°where¡¯ve ¡ª blimey, what¡¯ve done face?¡± said ron, goggling along everyone else vicinity 
¡°why, what¡¯s wrong it?¡± said harry, grabbing spoon squinting distorted reflection 
¡°you¡¯re covered blood!¡± said hennione

¡°but ¡ª ¡± said hennione 
¡°not now, hermione,¡± said harry, darkly significant voice 
hoped much would assume involved something heroic, preferably involving couple death eaters dementor 
course, malfoy would spread story wide could, always chance wouldn¡¯t reach many gryffindor ears 
reached across ron couple chicken legs handful chips, could take vanished, replaced puddings 
¡°you missed sorting, anyway,¡± said hermione, ron dived large chocolate gateau

hagrid never quite managed comport dignity professor mcgonagall, head gryffindor house, top whose head came somewhere hagrid ¡¯s elbow shoulder sitting side side, looking disapprovingly enthusiastic greeting 
harry surprised see divination teacher, professor trelawney, sitting hagrid¡¯s side; rarely left tower room, never seen start-of-tenn feast

always considered bit fraud, harry shocked discover end previous term made prediction caused lord voldemort kill harry¡¯s parents attack harry

great beaconlike eyes swiveled direction; hastily looked away toward slytherin table

¡°so professor slughorn want?¡± hermione asked

felt feet leave office floor; falling, falling whirling darkness then, quite sud-denly, blinking dazzling sunlight 
eyes adjusted, dumbledore landed beside 
standing country lane bordered high, tangled hedgerows, beneath summer sky bright blue forget-me-not 
ten feet front stood short, plump man wearing enonnously thick glasses reduced eyes molelike specks 
reading wooden signpost sticking brambles left-hand side road 
harry knew must ogden; person sight, also wearing strange assortment clothes often chosen inexperienced wizards trying look like muggles: case, frock coat spats striped one-piece bathing costume 
harry time register bizarre appearance, however, ogden set brisk walk lane 
dumbledore harry followed

walked short way nothing see hedgerows, wide blue sky overhead swishing, frock-coated figure ahead 
lane curved left fell away, sloping steeply hillside, sudden, unexpected view whole valley laid front 
harry could see village, undoubtedly little hangleton, nestled two steep hills, church graveyard clearly visible 
across valley, set opposite hillside, handsome manor house surrounded wide expanse velvety green lawn 
ogden broken reluctant trot due steep downward slope 
dumbledore lengthened stride, harry hurried keep 
thought little hangleton must final destination wondered, done night found slughorn, approach distance 
soon discovered mistaken thinking going village, however

dumbledore harry followed onto narrow dirt track bordered higher wilder hedgerows left behind 
path crooked, rocky, potholed, sloping down-hill like last one, seemed heading patch dark trees little 
sure enough, track soon opened copse, dumbledore harry came halt behind ogden, stopped drawn wand 
despite cloudless sky, old trees ahead cast deep, dark, cool shadows, seconds harry¡¯s eyes discerned building half-hidden amongst tangle trunks 
seemed strange location choose house, else odd decision leave trees growing nearby, blocking light view valley 
wondered whether inhabited; walls mossy many tiles fallen roof rafters visible places 
nettles grew around it, tips reaching windows, tiny thick grime 
concluded nobody could possibly live there, however, one windows thrown open clatter, thin trickle steam smoke issued it, though somebody cooking 
ogden moved forward quietly and, seemed harry, rather cautiously 
dark shadows trees slid him, stopped again, staring front door, somebody nailed dead snake 
rustle crack, man rags dropped nearest tree, landing feet right front ogden, leapt backward fast stood tails frock coat stumbled 
¡°you ¡¯re welcome

¡°yes, course,¡± said harry, slightly nonplussed 
¡°why can¡¯t ogden ¡ª ?¡± eyes found dead snake door again, suddenly understood

¡°ministry, it?¡± said older man, looking ogden

¡°are pure -blood?¡± asked, suddenly aggressive 
¡°that¡¯s neither there,¡± said ogden coldly, harry felt respect ogden rise 
apparently gaunt felt rather differently 
squinted ogden¡¯s face muttered, clearly supposed offensive tone, ¡°now come think it, i¡¯ve seen noses like village

¡°can think measure merope could taken make tom riddle forget muggle companion, fall love instead?¡± ¡°the imperius curse?¡± harry suggested 
¡°or love potion?¡± ¡°very good 
personally, inclined think used love potion 
sure would seemed romantic her, think would difficult, hot day, riddle riding alone, persuade take drink water

tom riddle left still pregnant 
¡± ¡°what went wrong?¡± asked harry 
¡°why love potion stop working?¡± ¡°again, guesswork,¡± said dumbledore, ¡°but believe merope, deeply love husband, could bear continue enslaving magical means

¡± chapter eleven hermione¡¯s helping hand hermione predicted, sixth years¡¯ free periods hours blissful relaxation ron anticipated, times attempt keep vast amount homework set 
studying though exams every day, lessons become demanding ever 
harry barely understood half professor mcgonagall said days; even hennione ask repeat instructions twice 
incredibly, hermione¡¯s increasing resentment, harry¡¯s best subject suddenly become potions, thanks half-blood prince 
nonverbal spells expected, defense dark arts, charms transfiguration 
harry frequently looked classmates common room mealtimes see purple face straining though overdosed u-no- poo; knew really struggling make spells work without saying incantations aloud 
relief get outside greenhouses; dealing dangerous plants ever herbology, least still allowed swear loudly venomous tentacula seized unexpectedly behind 
one result enonnous workload frantic hours practicing nonverbal spells harry, ron, hermione far unable find time go visit hagrid 
stopped coming meals staff table, ominous sign, occasions passed corridors grounds, mysteriously failed notice hear greetings 
¡°we¡¯ve got go explain,¡± said hermione, looking hagrid¡¯s huge empty chair staff table following saturday breakfast

¡°we¡¯ll go quidditch,¡± harry assured 
missing hagrid, although like ron thought better without grawp lives 
¡°but trials might take morning, number people applied 
¡± felt slightly nervous confronting first hurdle captaincy 
¡°i dunno team¡¯s popular sudden 
¡± ¡°oh, come on, harry,¡± said hennione, suddenly impatient 
¡°it¡¯s quidditch that¡¯s popular, it¡¯s you! you¡¯ve never interesting, frankly, you¡¯ve never fanciable 
¡± ron gagged large piece kipper 
hennione spared one look disdain turning back harry 
¡°everyone knows you¡¯ve telling truth now, don¡¯t they? whole wizarding world admit right voldemort back really fought twice last two years escaped times 
they¡¯re calling ¡®the chosen one¡¯ ¡ª well, come on, can¡¯t see people fascinated you?¡± harry finding great hall hot sudden, even though ceiling still looked cold rainy 
¡°and you¡¯ve persecution ministry trying make unstable liar

¡± ¡°you still see brains got hold ministry, look,¡± said ron, shaking back sleeves 
¡°and doesn¡¯t hurt you¡¯ve grown foot summer either,¡± hennione finished, ignoring ron 
¡°i¡¯m tall,¡± said ron inconsequentially 
post owls arrived, swooping rain-flecked windows, scattering everyone droplets water 
people receiving post usual; anxious parents keen hear children reassure them, turn, well home 
harry received mail since start term; regular correspondent dead although hoped lupin might write occasionally, far disappointed 
surprised, therefore, see snowy white hedwig circling amongst brown gray owls 
landed front carrying large, square package 
moment later, identical package landed front ron, crushing beneath minuscule exhausted owl, pigwidgeon 
¡°ha!¡± said harry, unwrapping parcel reveal new copy advanced potion-making, fresh flourish blotts 
¡°oh good,¡± said hennione, delighted 
¡°now give graffitied copy back

swapped covers, tapped each, said, ¡°reparo!¡± sat prince¡¯s copy, disguised new book, sat fresh copy flourish blotts, looking thoroughly secondhand 
¡°i¡¯ll give slughom back new one, can¡¯t complain, cost nine galleons 
¡± hermione pressed lips together, looking angry disapproving, distracted third owl landing front carrying day¡¯s copy daily prophet 
unfolded hastily scanned front page 
¡°anyone know dead?¡± asked ron determinedly casual voice; posed question every time hermione opened paper 
¡°no, dementor attacks,¡± said hermione 
¡°and arrest 
¡± ¡°excellent, who?¡± said harry, thinking bellatrix lestrange 
¡°stan shunpike,¡± said hermione 
¡°what?¡± said harry, startled 
¡° ¡®stanley shunpike, conductor popular wizarding conveyance knight bus, arrested suspicion death eater activity 
mr 
shunpike, 21, taken custody late last night raid clapham home 


¡°stan shunpike, death eater?¡± said harry, remembering spotty youth first met three years 
¡°no way!¡± ¡°he might put imperius curse,¡± said ron reasonably 
¡°you never tell 
¡± ¡°it doesn¡¯t look like it,¡± said hennione, still reading 
¡°it says arrested overheard talking death eaters¡¯ secret plans pub

¡°if imperius curse, he¡¯d hardly stand around gossiping plans, would he?¡± ¡°it sounds like trying make knew did,¡± said ron 
¡°isn¡¯t one claimed going become minister magic trying chat veela?¡± ¡°yeah, that¡¯s him,¡± said harry 
¡°i dunno they¡¯re playing at, taking stan seriously

¡°people terrified ¡ª know patil twins¡¯ parents want go home? eloise midgen already withdrawn

¡°but hogwarts safer homes, bound be! we¡¯ve got aurors, extra protective spells, we¡¯ve got dumbledore!¡± ¡°i don¡¯t think we¡¯ve got time,¡± said hermione quietly, glancing toward staff table top prophet 
¡°haven¡¯t noticed? seat¡¯s empty often hagrid¡¯s past week 
¡± harry ron looked staff table 
headmaster¡¯s chair indeed empty 
harry came think it, seen dumbledore since private lesson week ago 
¡°i think he¡¯s left school something order,¡± said hermione low voice 
¡°i mean 


it¡¯s looking serious, isn¡¯t it?¡± harry ron answer, harry knew thinking thing 
horrible incident day before, hannah abbott taken herbology told mother found dead 
seen hannah since 
left gryffindor table five minutes later head quidditch pitch, passed lavender brown parvati patil 
remembering hermione said patil twins¡¯ parents wanting leave hogwarts, harry unsurprised see two best friends whispering together, looking distressed 
surprise ron drew level them, parvati suddenly nudged lavender, looked around gave ron wide smile 
ron blinked her, returned smile uncertainly 
walk instantly became something like strut 
harry resisted temptation laugh, remembering ron refrained malfoy broken harry¡¯s nose; hermione, however, looked cold distant way stadium cool, misty drizzle, departed find place stands without wishing ron good luck 
harry expected, trials took morning 
half gryffindor house seemed turned up, first years nervously clutching selection dreadful old school brooms, seventh years towered rest, looking coolly intimidating 
latter included large, wiry-haired boy harry recognized immediately hogwarts express 
¡°we met train, old sluggy¡¯s compartment,¡± said confidently, stepping crowd shake harry¡¯s hand 
¡°cormac mclaggen, keeper 
¡± ¡°you didn¡¯t try last year, you?¡± asked harry, taking note breadth mclaggen thinking would probably block three goal hoops without even moving 
¡°i hospital wing held trials,¡± said mclaggen, something swagger 
¡°ate pound doxy eggs bet 
¡± ¡°right,¡± said harry 
¡°well 


wait 


¡± pointed edge pitch, close hermione sitting 
thought saw flicker annoyance pass mclaggen¡¯s face wondered whether mclaggen expected preferential treatment ¡°old sluggy¡¯s¡± favorites 
harry decided start basic test, asking applicants team divide groups ten fly around pitch 
good decision: first ten made first years, could plainer hardly ever flown 
one boy managed remain airborne seconds, surprised promptly crashed one goal posts 
second group comprised ten silliest girls harry ever encountered, who, blew whistle, merely fell giggling clutching one another 
romilda vane amongst 
told leave pitch, quite cheerfully went sit stands heckle everyone else 
third group pileup halfway around pitch 
fourth group come without broomsticks 
fifth group hufflepuffs 
¡°if there¡¯s anyone else who¡¯s gryffindor,¡± roared harry, starting get seriously annoyed, ¡°leave now, please! pause, couple little ravenclaws went sprinting pitch, snorting laughter 
two hours, many complaints, several tantrums, one involving crashed comet two sixty several broken teeth, harry found three chasers: katie bell, returned team excellent trial; new find called demelza robins, particularly good dodging bludgers; ginny weasley, outflown competition scored seventeen goals boot 
pleased though choices, harry also shouted hoarse many complainers enduring similar battle rejected beaters 
¡°that¡¯s final decision don¡¯t get way keepers i¡¯ll hex you,¡± bellowed 
neither chosen beaters old brilliance fred george, still reasonably pleased them: jimmy peakes, short broad-chested third-year boy managed raise lump size egg back harry¡¯s head ferociously hit bludger, ritchie coote, looked weedy aimed well 
joined katie, demelza, ginny stands watch selection last team member 
harry deliberately left trial keepers last, hoping emptier stadium less pressure concerned 
unfortunately, however, rejected players number people come watch lengthy breakfast joined crowd now, larger ever 
keeper flew goal hoops, crowd roared jeered equal measure 
harry glanced ron, always problem nerves; harry hoped winning final match last term might cured it, apparently not: ron delicate shade green 
none first five applicants saved two goals apiece 
harry¡¯s great disappointment, cormac mclaggen saved four penalties five 
last one, however, shot completely wrong direction; crowd laughed booed mclaggen returned ground grinding teeth 
ron looked ready pass mounted cleansweep eleven 
¡°good luck!¡± cried voice stands 
harry looked around, expecting see hermione, lavender brown 
would quite liked hidden face hands, moment later, thought captain ought show slightly grit, turned watch ron trial 
yet need worried: ron saved one, two, three, four, five penalties row 
delighted, resisting joining cheers crowd difficulty, harry turned mclaggen tell that, unfortunately, ron beaten him, find mclaggen¡¯s red face inches 
stepped back hastily 
¡°his sister didn¡¯t really try,¡± said mclaggen menacingly 
vein pulsing temple like one harry often ad-mired uncle vernon¡¯s 
¡°she gave easy save 
¡± ¡°rubbish,¡± said harry coldly 
¡°that one nearly missed 
¡± mclaggen took step nearer harry, stood ground time 
¡°give another go 
¡± ¡°no,¡± said harry 
¡°you¡¯ve go 
saved four 
ron saved five 
ron¡¯s keeper, fair square 
get way 
¡± thought moment mclaggen might punch him, contented ugly grimace stonned away, growling sounded like threats thin air 
harry turned around find new team beaming 
¡°well done,¡± croaked 
¡°you flew really well ¡ª ¡± ¡°you brilliantly, ron!¡± time really hennione running toward stands; harry saw lavender walking pitch, ann arm parvati, rather grumpy expression face 
ron looked extremely pleased even taller usual grinned team hermione 
fixing time first full practice following thursday, harry, ron, hermione bade good-bye rest team headed toward hagrid¡¯s 
watery sun trying break clouds stopped drizzling last 
harry felt extremely hungry; hoped would some-thing eat hagrid¡¯s 
¡°i thought going miss fourth penalty,¡± ron saying happily 
¡°tricky shot demelza, see, bit spin ¡ª ¡± ¡°yes, yes, magnificent,¡± said hennione, looking amused 
¡°i better mclaggen anyway,¡± said ron highly satisfied voice

¡°thanks lot, demelza 
¡± chapter twelve silver opals dumbledore, doing? harry caught sight headmaster twice next weeks 
rarely appeared meals anymore, harry sure hermione right thinking leaving school days time 
dumbledore forgotten lessons supposed giving harry? dumbledore said lessons leading something prophecy; harry felt bolstered, comforted, felt slightly abandoned 
halfway october came first trip tenn hogsmeade 
harry wondered whether trips would still allowed, given increasingly tight security measures around school, pleased know going ahead; always good get castle grounds hours 
harry woke early morning trip, proving stonny, whiled away time breakfast reading copy advanced potion-making 
usually lie bed reading textbooks; sort behavior, ron rightly said, indecent anybody except hermione, simply weird way 
harry felt, however, half-blood princes copy advanced potion-making hardly qualified textbook 
harry pored book, realized much there, handy hints shortcuts potions earning glowing reputation slughom, also imaginative little jinxes hexes scribbled margins, harry sure, judging crossings-out revisions, prince invented 
harry already attempted prince¡¯s self-invented spells 
hex caused toenails grow alarmingly fast (he tried crabbe corridor, entertaining results); jinx glued tongue roof mouth (which twice used, general applause, unsuspecting argus filch); and, perhaps useful all, muffliato, spell filled ears anyone nearby unidentifiable buzzing, lengthy conversations could held class without overheard 
person find channs amusing hennione, maintained rigidly disapproving expression throughout refused talk harry used muffliato spell anyone vicinity 
sitting bed, harry turned book sideways examine closely scribbled instructions spell seemed caused prince trouble 
many crossings-out alterations, finally, crammed corner page, scribble: levicorpus (nvbl) wind sleet pounded relentlessly windows, neville snored loudly, harry stared letters brackets 
nvbl 


mean ¡°nonverbal 
¡± harry rather doubted would able bring particular spell; still difficulty nonverbal spells, something snape quick comment every

pointing wand nothing particular, gave upward flick said levicorpus! inside head 
¡°aaaaaaaargh!¡± flash light room full voices: everyone woken ron let yell 
harry sent advanced potion-making flying panic; ron dangling upside midair though invisible hook hoisted ankle 
¡°sorry!¡± yelled harry, dean seamus roared laughter, neville picked floor, fallen bed 
¡°hang ¡ª i¡¯ll let ¡ª ¡± groped potion book riffled panic, trying find right page; last located deciphered cramped word underneath spell: praying counter-jinx, harry thought liberacorpus! might 
another flash light, ron fell heap onto mattress 
¡°sorry,¡± repeated harry weakly, dean seamus continued roar laughter 
¡°tomorrow,¡± said ron muffled voice, ¡°i¡¯d rather set alann clock 
¡± time got dressed, padding several mrs 
weasleys hand- knitted sweaters carrying cloaks, scarves, gloves, ron¡¯s shock subsided decided harry¡¯s new spell highly amusing; amusing, fact, lost time regaling hermione story sat breakfast 
¡° 


another flash, light landed bed again!¡± ron grinned, helping sausages 
hermione cracked smile anecdote, turned expression wintry disapproval upon harry 
¡°was spell, chance, another one potion book yours?¡± asked 
harry frowned 
¡°always jump worst conclusion, don¡¯t you?¡± ¡°was it?¡± ¡°well 


yeah, was, what?¡± ¡°so decided try unknown, handwritten incantation see would happen?¡± ¡°why matter it¡¯s handwritten?¡± said harry, preferring answer rest question 
¡°because it¡¯s probably ministry magic approved,¡± said hennione 
¡°and also,¡± added, harry ron rolled eyes, ¡°because i¡¯m starting think prince character bit dodgy 
¡± harry ron shouted 
¡°it laugh!¡± said ron, upending ketchup bottle sausages 
¡°just laugh, hennione, that¡¯s all!¡± ¡°dangling people upside ankle?¡± said hennione 
¡°who puts time energy making spells like that?¡± ¡°fred george,¡± said ron, shrugging, ¡°it¡¯s kind thing 
and, er ¡ª ¡± ¡°my dad,¡± said hany 
remembered 
¡°what?¡± said ron hennione together 
¡°my dad used spell,¡± said harry 
¡°i ¡ª lupin told 
¡± last part true; fact, hany seen father use spell snape, never told ron hennione particular excursion pensieve 
now, however, wonderful possibility occuned 
could half-blood prince possibly ¡ª ? ¡°maybe dad use it, hany,¡± said hennione, ¡°but he¡¯s one 
we¡¯ve seen whole bunch people use it, case you¡¯ve forgotten 
dangling people air 
making float along, asleep, helpless 
¡± harry stared 
sinking feeling, remembered behavior death eaters quidditch world cup 
ron came aid 
¡°that different,¡± said robustly 
¡°they abusing 
harry dad laugh 
don¡¯t like prince, hennione,¡± added, pointing sausage sternly, ¡°because he¡¯s better potions ¡ª ¡± ¡°it¡¯s got nothing that!¡± said hennione, cheeks reddening 
¡°i think it¡¯s irresponsible start performing spells don¡¯t even know they¡¯re for, stop talking ¡®the prince¡¯ it¡¯s title, bet it¡¯s stupid nickname, doesn¡¯t seem though nice person me!¡± ¡°i don¡¯t see get from,¡± said harry heatedly 
¡°if he¡¯d budding death eater wouldn¡¯t boasting ¡®half-blood,¡¯ would he?¡± even said it, harry remembered father pure-blood, pushed thought mind; would worry later 
¡°the death eaters can¡¯t pure-blood, aren¡¯t enough pure-blood wizards left,¡± said hermione stubbornly 
¡°i expect half-bloods pretending pure 
it¡¯s muggle-boms hate, they¡¯d quite happy let ron join 
¡± ¡°there way they¡¯d let death eater!¡± said ron indignantly, bit sausage flying fork brandishing hermione hitting ernie macmillan head 
¡°my whole family blood traitors! that¡¯s bad muggle-borns death eaters!¡± ¡°and they¡¯d love me,¡± said harry sarcastically 
¡°we¡¯d best pals didn¡¯t keep trying 
¡± made ron laugh; even hennione gave grudging smile, distraction arrived shape ginny 
¡°hey, harry, i¡¯m supposed give 
¡± scroll parchment harry¡¯s name written upon familiar thin, slanting writing 
¡°thanks, ginny 


it¡¯s dumbledore¡¯s next lesson!¡± harry told ron hennione, pulling open parchment quickly reading contents 
¡°monday evening!¡± felt suddenly light happy 
¡°want join us hogsmeade, ginny?¡± asked 
¡°i¡¯m going dean ¡ª might see there,¡± replied, waving left 
filch standing oak front doors usual, checking names people pennission go hogsmeade 
process took even longer nonnal filch triple- checking everybody secrecy sensor 
¡°what matter we¡¯re smuggling dark stuff out?¡± demanded ron, eyeing long thin secrecy sensor apprehension 
¡°surely ought checking bring back in?¡± cheek earned extra jabs sensor, still wincing stepped wind sleet

harry wrapped scarf lower face; exposed part soon felt raw numb 
road village full students bent double bitter wind 
harry wondered whether might better time warm common room, finally reached hogsmeade saw zonko¡¯s joke shop boarded up, harry took confirmation trip destined fun 
ron pointed, thickly gloved hand, toward honeydukes, mercifully open, harry hermione staggered wake crowded shop 
¡°thank god,¡± shivered ron enveloped warm, toffee-scented air 
¡°let¡¯s stay afternoon 
¡± ¡°harry, m¡¯boy!¡± said booming voice behind 
¡°oh no,¡± muttered harry 
three turned see professor slughorn, wearing enonnous furry hat overcoat matching fur collar, clutching large bag crystalized pineapple, occupying least quarter shop 
¡°harry, that¡¯s three little suppers you¡¯ve missed now!¡± said slughom, poking genially chest 
¡°it won¡¯t do, m¡¯boy, i¡¯m determined you! miss granger loves them, don¡¯t you?¡± ¡°yes,¡± said hermione helplessly, ¡°they¡¯re really ¡ª ¡± ¡°so don¡¯t come along, harry?¡± demanded slughorn 
¡°well, i¡¯ve quidditch practice, professor,¡± said harry, indeed scheduling practices every time slughorn sent little, violet ribbon-adorned invitation 
strategy meant ron left out, usually laugh ginny, imagining hennione shut mclaggen zabini 
¡°well, certainly expect win first match hard work!¡± said slughom 
¡°but little recreation never hurt body 
now, monday night, can¡¯t possibly want practice weather 


¡± ¡°i can¡¯t, professor, i¡¯ve got ¡ª er ¡ª appointment professor dumbledore evening

¡°ah, well

¡°i can¡¯t believe you¡¯ve wriggled another one,¡± said hermione, shaking head 
¡°they¡¯re bad, know

¡± caught sight ron¡¯s expression 
¡°oh, look ¡ª they¡¯ve got deluxe sugar quills ¡ª would last hours!¡± glad hermione changed subject, harry showed much interest new extra- large sugar quills would normally done, ron continued look moody merely shrugged hermione asked wanted go next

street busy; nobody lingering chat, hurrying toward destinations 
exceptions two men little ahead them, standing outside three broomsticks 
one tall thin; squinting rain-washed glasses harry recognized barman worked hogsmeade pub, hog¡¯s head 
harry, ron, hermione drew closer, barman drew cloak tightly around neck walked away, leaving shorter man fumble something arms

¡°well, i¡¯ll see ¡ª ouch!¡± harry pinned mundungus wall pub throat 
holding fast one hand, pulled wand

harry thinking sirius, hated silver goblets anyway 
hermione drummed fingers table, eyes flickering ron bar

however, ron seemed gather worst look harry¡¯s face 
¡°dilligrout,¡± said darkly fat lady, climbed portrait hole common room 
neither mentioned ginny hennione again; indeed, barely spoke evening got bed silence, absorbed thoughts, harry lay awake long time, looking canopy four-poster trying convince feelings ginny entirely elder-brotherly 
lived, not, like brother sister summer, playing quidditch, teasing ron, laugh bill phlegm? known ginny years 


natural feel protective 


natural want look 


want rip dean limb limb kissing 





would control particular brotherly feeling 


ron gave great grunting snore 
¡¯s ron ¡¯s sister, harry told firmly 
ron¡¯s sister 
's out-of-bounds 
would risk friendship ron anything 
punched pillow comfortable shape waited sleep come, trying utmost allow thoughts stray anywhere near ginny 
harry awoke next morning feeling slightly dazed confused series dreams ron chased beater¡¯s bat, midday would happily exchanged dream ron real one, cold-shouldering ginny dean, also treating hurt bewildered hennione icy, sneering indifference 
more, ron seemed become, overnight, touchy ready lash average blast-ended skrewt 
harry spent day attempting keep peace ron hennione success; finally, hennione departed bed high dudgeon, ron stalked boys¡¯ donnitory swearing angrily several frightened first years looking 
hany¡¯s dismay, ron¡¯s new aggression wear next days 
worse still, coincided even deeper dip keeping skills, made still aggressive, final quidditch practice saturdays match, failed save every single goal chasers aimed him, bellowed everybody much reduced demelza robins tears

¡± ¡°you¡¯re pathetic you¡¯re resigning!¡± said harry fiercely, seizing ron front robes 
¡°you save anything you¡¯re form, it¡¯s mental problem you¡¯ve got!¡± ¡°you calling mental?¡± ¡°yeah, maybe am!¡± glared moment, ron shook head wearily 
¡°i know haven¡¯t got time find another keeper, i¡¯ll play tomorrow, lose,

tried boosting ron¡¯s confidence dinner, ron busy grumpy surly hennione notice 
harry persisted common room evening, assertion whole team would devastated ron left somewhat undennined fact rest team sitting huddle distant comer, clearly muttering ron casting nasty looks 
finally harry tried getting angry hope provoking ron defiant, hopefully goal-saving, attitude, strategy appear work better encouragement; ron went bed dejected hopeless ever 
harry lay awake long time darkness 
want lose upcoming match; first captain, determined beat draco malfoy quidditch even could yet prove suspicions

¡°oh, comes slytherin¡¯ first attempt goal, it¡¯s urquhart streaking pitch 59 harrys stomach turned 
¡° ¡ª weasley saves it, well, he¡¯s bound get lucky sometimes, suppose 

¡°that¡¯s right, smith, is,¡± muttered harry, grinning himself, dived amongst chasers eyes searching around hint elusive snitch 
half hour game gone, gryffindor leading sixty points zero, ron made truly spectacular saves, tips gloves, ginny scored four gryffindor¡¯ six goals 
effectively stopped zacharias wondering loudly whether two weasleys harry liked them, started peakes coote instead 
¡°of course, coote isn¡¯t really usual build beater,¡± said zacharias loftily, ¡°they¡¯ve generally got bit muscle ¡ª ¡± ¡°hit bludger him!¡± harry called coote zoomed past, coote, grinning broadly, chose aim next bludger harper instead, passing harry opposite direction 
harry pleased hear dull thu nk meant bludger found mark

hagrid already single-handedly delivered usual twelve christmas trees great hall; garlands holly tinsel twisted around banisters stairs; everlasting candles glowed inside helmets suits armor great bunches mistletoe hung intervals along corridors

ron, might found necessity detours excuse jealousy rather hilarity, simply roared laughter 
although harry much preferred new laughing, joking ron moody, aggressive model enduring last weeks, improved ron came heavy price 
firstly, harry put frequent presence lavender brown, seemed regard moment kissing ron moment wasted; secondly, harry found best friend two people seemed unlikely ever speak

¡°seen hennione?¡± asked mclaggen, forcing way throng minute later 
¡°no, sorry,¡± said harry, turned quickly join luna¡¯s conversation, forgetting split second talking 
¡°harry potter!¡± said professor trelawney deep, vibrant tones, noticing first time 
¡°oh, hello,¡± said harry unenthusiastically

¡°you seen gave me, first lesson, draught living death ¡ª never student produce finer first attempt, don¡¯t think even you, severus ¡ª ¡± ¡°really?¡± said snape quietly, eyes still boring harry, felt certain disquiet

¡°remind subjects you¡¯re taking, harry?¡± asked slughorn 
¡°defense dark arts, charms, transfiguration, herbology 


¡± ¡°all subjects required, short, auror,¡± said snape faintest sneer 
¡°yeah, well, that¡¯s i¡¯d like do,¡± said harry defiantly 
¡°and great one you¡¯ll make too!¡± boomed slughorn 
¡°i don¡¯t think auror, harry,¡± said luna unexpectedly 
everybody looked 
¡°the aurors part rotfang conspiracy, thought everyone knew 
they¡¯re planning bring ministry magic within using combination dark magic gum disease 
¡± harry inhaled half mead nose started laugh 
really, worth bringing luna 
emerging goblet, coughing, sopping wet still grinning, saw something calculated raise spirits even higher: draco malfoy dragged ear toward argus filch 
¡°professor slughorn,¡± wheezed filch, jowls aquiver maniacal light mischief- detection bulging eyes, ¡°i discovered boy lurking upstairs corridor 
claims invited party delayed setting 
issue invitation?¡± malfoy pulled free filchs grip, looking furious 
¡°all right, wasn¡¯t invited!¡± said angrily 
¡°i trying gate crash, happy?¡± ¡°no, i¡¯m not!¡± said filch, statement complete odds glee face 
¡°you¡¯re trouble, are! didn¡¯t headmaster say nighttime prowling¡¯s out, unless you¡¯ve got pennission, didn¡¯t he, eh?¡± ¡°that¡¯s right, argus, that¡¯s right,¡± said slughorn, waving hand 
¡°it¡¯s christmas, it¡¯s crime want come party 
once, we¡¯ll forget punishment; may stay, draco 
filich¡¯s expression outraged disappointment perfectly predictable; why, harry wondered, watching him, malfoy look almost equally unhappy? snape looking malfoy though angry 


possible? 


little afraid? almost harry registered seen, filch turned shuffled away, muttering breath; malfoy composed face smile thanking slughorn generosity, snape ¡¯s face smoothly inscrutable 
¡°it¡¯s nothing, nothing,¡± said slughorn, waving away malfoy¡¯s thanks 
¡°i know grandfather, 


¡± ¡°he always spoke highly you, sir,¡± said malfoy quickly 
¡°said best potion- maker he¡¯d ever known 


¡± harry stared malfoy 
sucking-up intrigued him; watched malfoy snape long time 
fact malfoy did, all, look little ill 
first time seen malfoy close ages; saw malfoy dark shadows eyes distinctly grayish tinge skin 
¡°i¡¯d like word you, draco,¡± said snape suddenly 
¡°now, severus,¡± said slughorn, hiccuping again, ¡°it¡¯s christmas, don¡¯t hard ¡ª ¡± ¡°i head house, shall decide hard, otherwise, be,¡± said snape curtly 
¡°follow me, draco 
¡± left, snape leading way, malfoy looking resentful 
harry stood moment, irresolute, said, ¡°i¡¯ll back bit, luna ¡ª er ¡ª bathroom 
¡± ¡°all right,¡± said cheerfully, thought heard her, hurried crowd, resume subject rotfang conspiracy professor trelawney, seemed sincerely interested 
easy, party, pull invisibility cloak pocket throw himself, corridor quite deserted 
difficult finding snape malfoy 
harry ran corridor, noise feet masked music loud talk still issuing slughorn¡¯ office behind 
perhaps snape taken malfoy office dungeons 


perhaps escorting back slytherin common room 


harry pressed ear door door dashed corridor until, great jolt excitement, crouched keyhole last classroom corridor heard voices

¡± ¡°who suspects me?¡± said malfoy angrily 
¡°for last time, didn¡¯t it, okay? bell girl must¡¯ve enemy noone knows ¡ª don¡¯t look like that! know you¡¯re doing, i¡¯m stupid, won¡¯t work ¡ª stop you!¡± pause snape said quietly, ¡°ah

¡°defense dark arts ¡ª joke, isn¡¯t it, act? like us need protecting dark arts ¡ª ¡± ¡°it act crucial success, draco!¡± said snape 
¡°where think would years, known act? listen me! incautious, wandering around night, getting caught, placing reliance assistants like crabbe goyle ¡ª ¡± ¡°they¡¯re ones, i¡¯ve got people side, better people!¡± ¡°then confide me, ¡ª ¡± ¡°i know you¡¯re to! want steal glory!¡± another pause, snape said coldly, ¡°you speaking like child

malfoy striding away corridor, past open door slughorns office, around distant corner, sight 
hardly daring breathe, harry remained crouched snape emerged slowly classroom 
expression unfathomable, returned party 
harry remained floor, hidden beneath cloak, mind racing

now, suggest press on, unless there¡¯s anything else ¡ª ?¡± ¡°there is, actually, sir,¡± said harry 
¡°it¡¯s malfoy snape 
¡± ¡°professor snape, harry 
¡± ¡°yes, sir

¡± dumbledore listened harry¡¯s story impassive face 
harry finished speak moments, said, ¡°thank telling this, harry, suggest put mind 
think great importance 
¡± ¡°not great importance?¡± repeated harry incredulously 
¡°professor, understand ¡ª ?¡± ¡°yes, harry, blessed extraordinary brainpower, understood everything told me,¡± said dumbledore, little sharply 
¡°i think might even consider possibility understood 
again, glad confided me, let reassure told anything causes disquiet 
¡± harry sat seething silence, glaring dumbledore 
going on? mean dumbledore indeed ordered snape find malfoy doing, case already heard everything harry told snape? really worried heard, pretending be? ¡°so, sir,¡± said harry, hoped polite, calm voice, ¡°you definitely still trust ¡ª ?¡± ¡°i tolerant enough answer question already,¡± said dumbledore, sound tolerant anymore 
¡°my answer changed 
¡± ¡°i think not,¡± said snide voice; phineas nigellus evidently pretending asleep 
dumbledore ignored 
¡°and now, harry, must insist press 
important things discuss evening 
¡± harry sat feeling mutinous 
would refused permit change subject, insisted upon arguing case malfoy? though read harry¡¯s mind, dumbledore shook head 
¡°ah, harry, often happens, even best friends! us believes say much important anything might contribute!¡± ¡°i don¡¯t think you¡¯ve got say unimportant, sir,¡± said harry stiffly 
¡°well, quite right, not,¡± said dumbledore briskly 
¡°i two memories show evening, obtained enonnous difficulty, second is, think, important collected 
¡± harry say anything this; still felt angry reception confidences received, could see gained arguing 
¡°so,¡± said dumbledore, ringing voice, ¡°we meet evening continue tale tom riddle, left last lesson poised threshold years hogwarts

however, sense never try charm channed many colleagues 
¡°as moved school, gathered group dedicated friends; call that, want better tenn, although already indicated, riddle undoubtedly felt affection

¡± dumbledore rose, harry saw holding small crystal bottle filled swirling, pearly memory 
¡°i lucky collect this,¡± said, poured gleaming mass pensieve 
¡°as understand experienced 
shall we?¡± harry stepped stone basin bowed obediently face sank surface memory; felt familiar sensation falling nothingness landed upon dirty stone floor almost total darkness 
took several seconds recognize place, time dumbledore landed beside 
gaunts¡¯ house indescribably filthy anywhere harry ever seen 
ceiling thick cobwebs, floor coated grime; moldy rotting food lay upon table amidst mass crusted pots 
light came single guttering candle placed feet man hair beard overgrown harry could see neither eyes mouth 
slumped annchair fire, harry wondered moment whether dead 
came loud knock door man jerked awake, raising wand right hand short knife left 
door creaked open

voldemort¡¯s eyes moved slowly around hovel found man armchair

¡°you!¡± bellowed

¡°you speak ?¡± ¡°yes, speak it¡± said riddle 
moved forward room, allowing door swing shut behind 
harry could help feel resentful admiration voldemort¡¯s complete lack fear 
race merely expressed disgust and, perhaps, disappointment 
¡° marvolo? ¡± asked 
¡°dead¡± said 
¡°died years ago, 7 he?¡± riddle frowned 
¡°who you, then?¡± ¡° i¡¯m morfin, 77?¡± ¡° marvolo ¡¯s son?¡± course am, 


¡± morfin pushed hair dirty face, better see riddle, harry saw wore marvolo¡¯s black-stoned ring right hand

¡° look mighty like muggle 
¡± ¡°what mugglel¡± said riddle sharply 
¡° muggle sister took fancy to, muggle lives big house way,¡± said morfin, spat unexpectedly upon floor 
¡° look right like

morfin looked slightly dazed swayed little, still clutching edge table support 
¡® come back, see,¡± added stupidly 
voldemort gazing morfin though appraising possibilities 
moved little closer said, ¡° riddle came back?¡± ¡° ar , left her, serve right, marrying filthl¡± said morfin, spitting floor 
¡° robbed us, mind, ran off, ¡¯s locket, eh, ¡¯s slytherin ¡¯s locket?¡± voldemort answer 
morfin working rage again; brandished knife shouted, ¡° dishonored us, did, little slut! ¡¯re you, coming asking questions that? it¡¯s over, innit 


it¡¯s 


¡± looked away, staggering slightly, voldemort moved forward 
so, unnatural darkness fell, extinguishing voldemort¡¯ lamp morfin¡¯s candle, extinguishing everything 


dumbledore¡¯s fingers closed tightly around harry¡¯s arm soaring back present 
soft golden light dumbledore¡¯s office seemed dazzle harry¡¯s eyes impenetrable darkness 
¡°is all?¡± said harry 
¡°why go dark, happened?¡± ¡°because morfin could remember anything point onward,¡± said dumbledore, gesturing harry back seat 
¡°when awoke next morning, lying floor, quite alone 
marvolo¡¯s ring gone 
¡°meanwhile, village little hangleton, maid running along high street, screaming three bodies lying drawing room big house: tom riddle senior mother father 
¡°the muggle authorities perplexed 
far aware, know day riddles died, avada kedavra curse usually leave sign damage 


exception sits me,¡± dumbledore added, nod harry¡¯s scar 
¡°the ministry, hand, knew wizard¡¯s murder 
also knew convicted muggle-hater lived across valley riddle house, muggle-hater already imprisoned attacking one murdered people 
¡°so ministry called upon morfin 
need question him, use veritaserum legilimency

¡± ¡°so voldemort stole morfin¡¯ wand used it?¡± said harry, sitting straight 
¡°that¡¯s right,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°we memories show us this, think fairly sure happened 
voldemort stupefied uncle, took wand, proceeded across valley ¡®the big house way 
¡¯ murdered muggle man abandoned witch mother, and, good measure, muggle grandparents, thus obliterating last unworthy riddle line revenging upon father never wanted 
returned gaunt hovel, performed complex bit magic would implant false memory uncle¡¯s mind, laid morfin¡¯s wand beside unconscious owner, pocketed ancient ring wore, departed 
¡± ¡°and morfin never realized hadn¡¯t done it?¡± ¡°never,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°he gave, say, full boastful confession 
¡± ¡°but real memory time!¡± ¡°yes, took great deal skilled legilimency coax him,¡± said dumbledore, ¡°and anybody delve morfin¡¯s mind already confessed crime? however, able secure visit morfin last weeks life, time attempting discover much could voldemort¡¯s past

ministry reached decision, however, morfin died 
¡± ¡°but come ministry didn¡¯t realize voldemort done morfin?¡± harry asked angrily ¡°he underage time, wasn¡¯t he? thought could detect underage magic!¡± ¡°you quite right ¡ª detect magic, perpetrator: remember blamed ministry hover charm was, fact, cast ¡ª ¡± ¡°dobby,¡± growled harry; injustice still rankled 
¡°so you¡¯re underage magic inside adult witch wizard¡¯s house, ministry won¡¯t know?¡± ¡°they certainly unable tell performed magic,¡± said dumbledore, smiling slightly look great indignation harrys face 
¡°they rely witch wizard parents enforce offspring¡¯s obedience within walls 
¡± ¡°well, that¡¯s rubbish,¡± snapped harry 
¡°look happened here, look happened morfin!¡± ¡°i agree,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°whatever morfin was, deserve die did, blamed murders committed 
getting late, want see memory part 


¡± dumbledore took inside pocket another crystal phial harry fell silent once, remembering dumbledore said important one collected 
harry noticed contents proved difficult empty pensieve, though congealed slightly; memories go bad? ¡°this take long,¡± said dumbledore, finally emptied phial 
¡°we shall back know 
pensieve, 


¡± harry fell silver surface, landing time right front man recognized 
much younger horace slughorn 
harry used bald found sight slughorn thick, shiny, straw-colored hair quite disconcerting; looked though head thatched, though already shiny galleon-sized bald patch crown 
mustache, less massive days, gingery-blond 
quite round slughorn harry knew, though golden buttons richly embroidered waistcoat taking fair amount strain 
little feet resting upon velvet pouffe, sitting well back comfortable winged armchair, one hand grasping small glass wine, searching box crystalized pineapple 
harry looked around dumbledore appeared beside saw standing slughorn¡¯ office 
half dozen boys sitting around slughorn, harder lower seats his, mid-teens 
harry recognized voldemort 
handsome face looked relaxed boys 
right hand lay negligently upon arm chair; jolt, harry saw wearing marvolo¡¯s gold-and-black ring; already killed father 
¡°sir, true professor merrythought retiring?¡± asked 
¡°tom, tom, knew couldn¡¯t tell you,¡± said slughorn, wagging reproving, sugar-covered finger riddle, though ruining effect slightly winking 
¡°i must say, i¡¯d like know get information, boy, knowledgeable half staff, 
¡± riddle smiled; boys laughed cast admiring looks 
¡°what uncanny ability know things shouldn¡¯t, careful flattery people matter ¡ª thank pineapple, way, you¡¯re quite right, favorite ¡ª ¡± several boys tittered, something odd happened 
whole room suddenly filled thick white fog, harry could see nothing face dumbledore, standing beside 
slughorn¡¯s voice rang mist, unnaturally loudly, ¡°you ¡¯ll go wrong, boy, mark words 
¡± fog cleared suddenly appeared yet nobody made allusion it, anybody look though anything unusual happened 
bewildered, harry looked around small golden clock standing upon slughom¡¯s desk chimed eleven o¡¯clock 
¡°good gracious, time already?¡± said slughom 
¡°you¡¯d better get going, boys, we¡¯ll trouble 
lestrange, want essay tomorrow it¡¯s detention

¡± slughorn pulled annchair carried empty glass desk boys filed 
voldemort, however, stayed behind 
harry could tell dawdled deliberately, wanting last room slughom 
¡°look sharp, tom,¡± said slughorn, turning around finding still present 
¡°you don¡¯t want caught bed hours, prefect 


¡± ¡°sir, wanted ask something 
¡± ¡°ask away, then, m¡¯boy, ask away 


¡± ¡°sir, wondered know 


horcruxes?¡± happened again: dense fog filled room harry could see slughorn voldemort all; dumbledore, smiling serenely beside 
slughorn¡¯s voice boomed again, done 
¡°i ¡¯t know anything horcruxes ¡¯t tell did! get ¡¯t let catch mentioning again!¡± ¡°well, that¡¯s that,¡± said dumbledore placidly beside harry 
¡°time go 
¡± harry¡¯s feet left floor fall, seconds later, back onto rug front dumbledore¡¯s desk 
¡°that¡¯s is?¡± said harry blankly 
dumbledore said important memory all, could see significant 
admittedly fog, fact nobody seemed noticed it, odd, nothing seemed happened except voldemort asked question failed get answer 
¡°as might noticed,¡± said dumbledore, reseating behind desk, ¡°that memory tampered 
¡± ¡°tampered with?¡± repeated harry, sitting back 
¡°certainly,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°professor slughorn meddled recollections 
¡± ¡°but would that?¡± ¡°because, think, ashamed remembers,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°he tried rework memory show better light, obliterating parts wish see 
is, noticed, crudely done, good, shows true memory still beneath alterations 
¡°and so, first time, giving homework, harry 
job persuade professor slughom divulge real memory, undoubtedly crucial piece infonnation 
¡± harry stared 
¡°but surely, sir,¡± said, keeping voice respectful possible, ¡°you don¡¯t need ¡ª could use legilimency 


veritaserum 


¡± ¡°professor slughorn extremely able wizard expecting both,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°he much accomplished occlumency poor morfin gaunt, would astonished carried antidote veritaserum ever since coerced giving travesty recollection

important, know seen real thing 
so, good luck 


good night 
¡± little taken aback abrupt dismissal, harry got feet quickly 
¡°good night, sir 
¡± closed study door behind him, distinctly heard phineas nigellus say, ¡°i can¡¯t see boy able better you, dumbledore 
¡± ¡°i wouldn¡¯t expect to, phineas,¡± replied dumbledore, fawkes gave another low, musical cry

ron thought harry unlikely trouble slughom 
¡°he loves you,¡± said breakfast, waving airy forkful fried egg 
¡°won¡¯t refuse anything, he? little potions prince

¡°he must determined hide really happened dumbledore couldn¡¯t get him,¡± said low voice, stood deserted, snowy courtyard break

¡°they must really advanced dark magic, would voldemort wanted know them? think it¡¯s going difficult get information, harry, you¡¯ll careful approach slughorn, think strategy 


¡± ¡°ron reckons hang back potions afternoon 


¡± ¡°oh, well, won-won thinks that, you¡¯d better it,¡± said, flaring 
¡°after all, won-won¡¯s judgement ever faulty?¡± ¡°hermione, can¡¯t ¡ª ¡± ¡°no!¡± said angrily, stonned away, leaving harry alone ankle-deep snow 
potions lessons uncomfortable enough days, seeing harry, ron hermione share desk 
today, hermione moved cauldron around table close ernie, ignored harry ron 
¡°what¡¯vc vow done?¡± ron muttered harry, looking hermione¡¯s haughty profile 
harry could answer, slughom calling silence front room 
¡°settle down, settle down, please! quickly, now, lots work get afternoon! golpalott¡¯s third law

¡°it¡¯s shame prince won¡¯t able help much this, harry,¡± said brightly straightened 
¡°you understand principles involved time

¡°you sure prince hasn¡¯t got tips?¡± ron muttered harry 
harry pulled trusty copy advanced potion-making turned chapter antidotes 
golpalott¡¯s third law, stated word word hermione recited it, single illuminating note prince¡¯s hand explain meant 
apparently prince, like hermione, difficulty understanding 
¡°nothing,¡± said harry gloomily 
hermione waving wand enthusiastically cauldron 
unfortunately, could copy spell good non-verbal incantations need say words aloud 
ernie macmillan, however, muttering, ¡°specialis revelio!¡± cauldron, sounded impressive, harry ron hastened imitate 
took harry five minutes realize reputation best potion-maker class crashing around ears 
slughorn peered hopefully cauldron first circuit dungeon, preparing exclaim delight usually did, instead withdrawn head hastily, coughing, smell bad eggs overwhelmed 
hennione¡¯s expression could smugger; loathed out-performed every potions class 
decanting mysteriously separated ingredients poison ten different crystal phials 
avoid watching irritating sight anything else, harry bent half- blood prince¡¯s book turned pages unnecessary force

harry stared words moment 
hadn¡¯t once, long ago, heard bezoars? hadn¡¯t snape mentioned first ever potions lesson? ¡°a stone taken stomach goat, protect poisons 
¡¯¡¯'¡¯ answer golpalott problem, snape still teacher, harry would dared it, moment desperate measures 
hastened towards store cupboard rummaged within it, pushing aside unicorn horns tangles dried herbs found, back, small card box scribbled word bezoars 
opened box slughom called, ¡°two minutes left, everyone!¡± inside half dozen shrivelled brown objects, looking like dried-up kidneys real stones 
harry seized one, put box back cupboard hurried back cauldron 
¡°time¡¯s

¡°well, let¡¯s see you¡¯ve done! blaise 


got me?¡± slowly, slughorn moved around room, examining various antidotes 
nobody finished task, although hennione trying cram ingredients bottle slughorn reached 
ron given completely, merely trying avoid breathing putrid fumes issuing cauldron 
harry stood waiting, bezoar clutched slightly sweaty hand 
slughorn reached table last 
sniffed ernie¡¯s potion passed ron¡¯s grimace 
linger ron¡¯s cauldron, backed away swiftly, retching slightly 
¡°and you, harry,¡± said 
¡°what got show me?¡± harry held hand, bezoar sitting palm 
slughorn looked full ten seconds 
harry wondered, moment, whether going shout 
threw back head roared laughter 
¡°you¡¯ve got nerve, boy!¡± boomed, taking bezoar holding class could see 
¡°oh, you¡¯re like mother 


well, can¡¯t fault 


bezoar would certainly act antidote potions!¡± hermione, sweaty-faced soot nose, looked livid 
half-finished antidote, comprising fifty-two ingredients including chunk hair, bubbled sluggishly behind slughorn, eyes nobody harry 
¡°and thought bezoar yourself, you, harry?¡± asked gritted teeth 
¡°that¡¯s individual spirit real potion-maker needs!¡± said slughorn happily, harry could reply 
¡°just like mother, intuitive grasp potion-making, it¡¯s undoubtedly lily gets 


yes, harry, yes, you¡¯ve got bezoar hand, course would trick 


although don¡¯t work everything, pretty rare, it¡¯s still worth knowing mix antidotes

¡°and extra ten points gryffindor sheer cheek!¡± still chuckling, waddled back desk front dungeon 
harry dawdled behind, taking inordinate amount time bag 
neither ron hermione wished luck left; looked rather annoyed 
last harry slughorn two left room 
¡°come on, now, harry, you¡¯ll late next lesson,¡± said slughorn affably, snapping gold clasps shut dragonskin briefcase 
¡°sir,¡± said harry, reminding irresistibly voldemort, ¡°i wanted ask something 
¡± ¡°ask away, then, dear boy, ask away 


¡± ¡°sir, wondered know 


horcruxes?¡± slughorn froze 
round face seemed sink upon 
licked lips said hoarsely, ¡°what say?¡± ¡°i asked whether know anything horcruxes, sir

voice changed completely 
genial more, shocked, terrified 
fumbled breast pocket pulled handkerchief, mopping sweating brow 
¡°dumbledore¡¯s shown ¡ª memory,¡± said slughorn 
¡°well? hasn¡¯t he?¡± ¡°yes,¡± said harry, deciding spot best lie 
¡°yes, course,¡± said slughorn quietly, still dabbing white face 
¡°of course 


well, you¡¯ve seen memory, harry, you¡¯ll know don¡¯t kn ow anything ¡ª anything¡± ¡ª repeated word forcefully ¡ª ¡°about horcruxes 
¡± seized dragonskin briefcase, stuffed handkerchief back pocket marched dungeon door 
¡°sir,¡± said harry desperately, ¡°i thought might bit memory ¡°did you?¡± said slughorn 
¡°then wrong, weren¡¯t you? wrong!¡± bellowed last word and, harry could say another word, slammed dungeon door behind 
neither ron hennione sympathetic harry told disastrous interview 
hennione still seething way harry triumphed without work properly 
ron resentful harry hadn¡¯t slipped bezoar, 
¡°it would¡¯ve looked stupid we¡¯d done it!¡± said harry irritably 
¡°look, try soften could ask voldemort, didn¡¯t i? oh, get grip!¡± added exasperation, ron winced sound name 
infuriated failure ron hennione ¡¯s attitudes, harry brooded next days next slughorn 
decided that, time being, would let slughorn think forgotten horcruxes; surely best lull false sense security returning attack 
hany question slughorn again, potions master reverted usual affectionate treatment him, appeared put matter mind 
harry awaited invitation one little evening parties, determined accept time, even reschedule quidditch practice 
unfortunately, however, invitation arrived 
harry checked hennione ginny: neither received invitation nor, far knew, anybody else 
harry could help wondering whether meant slughorn quite forgetful appeared, simply determined give harry additional opportunities question 
meanwhile, hogwarts library failed hermione first lime living memory 
shocked, even forgot annoyed harry trick bezoar, ¡°i haven¡¯t found one single explanation horcruxes do!¡± told 
¡°not single one! i¡¯ve right restricted section even horrible books, tell brew gruesome potions ¡ª nothing! could find this, introduciion magick mostc evile ¡ª listen ¡ª ¡®of horcrux, wickedest magical inventions, shall speak give direction¡¯

¡°oh, shut up,¡± snapped, stuffing back bag 
snow melted around school february arrived, replaced cold, dreary wetness 
purplish-grey clouds hung low castle constant fall chilly rain made lawns slippery muddy 
upshot sixth-years¡¯ first apparition lesson, scheduled saturday morning normal lessons would missed, took place great hall instead grounds

oddly colorless, transparent eyelashes, wispy hair insubstantial air, though single gust wind might blow away 
harry wondered whether constant disappearances reappearances somehow diminished substance, whether frail build ideal anyone wishing vanish 
¡°good morning,¡± said ministry wizard, students arrived heads house called quiet 
¡°my name wilkie twycross shall ministry apparition instructor next twelve weeks 
hope able prepare apparition test time ¡ª ¡± ¡°malfoy, quiet pay attention!¡± barked professor mcgonagall 
everybody looked round 
malfoy flushed dull pink; looked furious stepped away crabbe, appeared whispered argument 
harry glanced quickly snape, also looked annoyed, though harry strongly suspected less malfoy¡¯s rudeness fact mcgonagall reprimanded one house 
¡° ¡ª time, many may ready take test,¡± twycross continued, though interruption 
¡°as may know, usually impossible apparate disapparate within hogwarts

¡°i would like place clear five feet space front

¡°harry, going?¡± demanded hermione

think snape tried hard enough investigate slytherins 


or, perhaps, investigate single slytherin: malfoy? dumbledore want harry anything foolish, take matters hands, pretended nothing harry¡¯s suspicions? seemed likely 
might even dumbledore want anything distract harry lessons, procuring memory slughorn 
perhaps dumbledore think right confide suspicions staff sixteen-year-olds

¡± pushed past harry disappeared spiral staircase; heard stumble halfway down, harry guessed tripped one trailing shawls 
¡°please close door sit down, harry,¡± said dumbledore, sounding rather tired 
harry obeyed, noticing took usual seat front dumbledore ¡¯s desk pensieve lay more, two tiny crystal bottles full swirling memory 
¡°professor trelawney still isn¡¯t happy firenze teaching, then?¡± harry asked 
¡°no,¡± said dumbledore, ¡°divination turning much trouble could foreseen, never studied subject 
cannot ask firenze return forest, outcast, ask sybill trelawney leave 
ourselves, idea danger would outside castle 
know ¡ª think would unwise enlighten ¡ª made prophecy voldemort, see 
¡± dumbledore heaved deep sigh, said, ¡°but never mind staffing problems 
much important matters discuss 
firstly ¡ª managed task set end previous lesson?¡± ¡°ah,¡± said harry, brought short 
apparition lessons quidditch ron poisoned getting skull cracked determination find draco malfoy to, harry almost forgotten memory dumbledore asked extract professor slughom

¡°and feel exerted best efforts matter, you? exercised considerable ingenuity? left depth cunning unplumbed quest retrieve memory?¡± ¡°well,¡± harry stalled, loss say next 
single attempt get hold memory suddenly seemed embarrassingly feeble 
¡°well 


day ron swallowed love potion mistake took professor slughorn 
thought maybe got professor slughom good enough mood ¡ª ¡± ¡°and work?¡± asked dumbledore 
¡°well, no, sir, ron got poisoned ¡ª ¡± ¡° ¡ª which, naturally, made forget trying retrieve memory; would expected nothing else, best friend danger 
became clear mr 
weasley going make full recovery, however, would hoped returned task set 
thought made clear important memory 
indeed, best impress upon crucial memory wasting time without 
¡± hot, prickly feeling shame spread top harry¡¯s head way body 
dumbledore raised voice, even sound angry, harry would preferred yell; cold disappointment worse anything 
¡°sir,¡± said, little desperately, ¡°it isn¡¯t wasn¡¯t bothered anything

realized wouldn¡¯t asked wasn¡¯t really important 
¡± ¡°thank saying that, harry,¡± said dumbledore quietly 
¡°may hope, then, give matter higher priority on? little point meeting tonight unless memory 
¡± ¡°i¡¯ll it, sir, i¡¯ll get him,¡± said earnestly 
¡°then shall say now,¡± said dumbledore kindly, ¡°but continue story left 
remember was?¡± ¡°yes, sir,¡± said harry quickly 
¡°voldemort killed father grandparents made look though uncle morfin 
went back hogwarts asked 


asked professor slughom horcruxes,¡± mumbled shamefacedly 
¡°very good,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°now, remember, hope, told outset meetings would entering realms guesswork speculation?¡± ¡°yes, sir 
¡± ¡°thus far, hope agree, shown reasonably firm sources fact deductions voldemort age seventeen?¡± harry nodded 
¡°but now, harry,¡± said dumbledore, ¡°now things become murkier stranger 
difficult find evidence boy riddle, almost impossible find anyone prepared reminisce man voldemort 
fact, doubt whether soul alive, apart himself, could give us full account life since left hogwarts 
however, two last memories would like share 
¡± dumbledore indicated two little crystal bottles gleaming beside pensieve 
¡°i shall glad opinion whether conclusions drawn seem likely 
¡± idea dumbledore valued opinion highly made harry feel even deeply ashamed failed task retrieving horcrux memory, shifted guiltily seat dumbledore raised first two bottles light examined 
¡°i hope tired diving people¡¯s memories, curious recollections, two,¡± said 
¡°this first one came old house-elf name hokey 
see hokey witnessed, must quickly recount lord voldemort left hogwarts 
¡°he reached seventh year schooling with, might expected, top grades every examination taken 
around him, classmates deciding jobs pursue left hogwarts 
nearly everybody expected spectacular things tom riddle, prefect, head boy, winner award special services school 
know several teachers, professor slughorn amongst them, suggested join ministry magic, offered set appointments, put touch useful contacts 
refused offers 
next thing staff knew, voldemort working borgin burkes 
¡± ¡°at borgin burkes?¡± harry repeated, stunned 
¡°at borgin burkes,¡± repeated dumbledore calmly 
¡°i think see attractions place held entered hokey¡¯s memory 
voldemort¡¯s first choice job 
hardly anyone knew time ¡ª one headmaster confided ¡ª voldemort first approached professor dippet asked whether could remain hogwarts teacher 
¡± ¡°he wanted stay here? why?¡± asked harry, amazed still 
¡°i believe several reasons, though confided none professor dippet,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°firstly, importantly, voldemort was, believe, attached school ever person 
hogwarts happiest; first place felt home 
¡± harry felt slightly uncomfortable words, exactly felt hogwarts 
¡°secondly, castle stronghold ancient magic 
undoubtedly voldemort penetrated many secrets students pass place, may felt still mysteries unravel, stores magic tap 
¡°and thirdly, teacher, would great power influence young witches wizards 
perhaps gained idea professor slughorn, teacher best terms, demonstrated influential role teacher play 
imagine instant voldemort envisaged spending rest life hogwarts, think saw useful recruiting ground, place might begin build army 
¡± ¡°but didn¡¯t get job, sir?¡± ¡°no, 
professor dippet told young eighteen, invited reapply years, still wished teach 
¡± ¡°how feel that, sir?¡± asked harry hesitantly 
¡°deeply uneasy,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°i advised armando appointment ¡ª give reasons given you, professor dippet fond voldemort convinced honesty 
want lord voldemort back school, especially position power 
¡± ¡°which job want, sir? subject want teach?¡± somehow, harry knew answer even dumbledore gave 
¡°defense dark arts 
taught time old professor name galatea merrythought, hogwarts nearly fifty years 
¡°so voldemort went borgin burkes, staff admired said waste was, brilliant young wizard like that, working shop 
however, voldemort mere assistant 
polite handsome clever, soon given particular jobs type exist place like borgin burkes, specializes, know, harry, objects unusual powerful properties 
voldemort sent persuade people part treasures sale partners, was, accounts, unusually gifted

¡°when say lots common,¡± said ron, sounding rather amused now, ¡°d¡¯you mean lives s-bend too?¡± ¡°no,¡± said myrtle defiantly, voice echoing loudly around old tiled bathroom 
¡°i mean he¡¯s sensitive, people bully too, feels lonely hasn¡¯t got anybody talk to, he¡¯s afraid show feelings cry!¡± ¡°there¡¯s boy crying?¡± said harry curiously 
¡°a young boy?¡± ¡°never mind!¡± said myrtle, small, leaky eyes fixed ron, definitely grinning

¡°the sewers, maybe 
¡± myrtle gave howl rage dived back toilet, causing water slop sides onto floor 
goading myrtle seemed put fresh heart ron 
¡°you¡¯re right,¡± said, swinging schoolbag back shoulder, ¡°i¡¯ll practice sessions hogsmeade decide taking test

harry felt rather jealous watching get ready go village; missed making trips there, particularly fine spring day, one first clear skies seen long time 
however, decided use time attempt another assault room requirement 
¡°you¡¯d better,¡± said hermione, confided plan ron entrance hall, ¡°to go straight slughorn¡¯s office try get memory 
¡± ¡°i¡¯ve trying!¡± said harry crossly, perfectly true 
lagged behind every potions lesson week attempt comer slughorn, potions master always left dungeon fast harry able catch

wished ron hermione luck, turned climbed marble staircase again, determined, whatever hennione said, devote hour two room requirement 
sight entrance hall, harry pulled marauder¡¯s map invisibility cloak bag 
concealed himself, tapped map, murmured, ¡°i solemnly swear good¡± scanned carefully 
sunday morning, nearly students inside various common rooms, gryffindors one tower, ravenclaws another, slytherins dungeons, hufflepuffs basement near kitchens 
stray person meandered around library corridor 
people grounds, there, alone seventh- floor corridor, gregory goyle 
sign room requirement, harry worried that; goyle standing guard outside it, room open, whether map aware 
therefore sprinted stairs, slowing reached comer corridor, began creep, slowly, toward little girl, clutching heavy brass scales, hermione kindly helped fortnight 
waited right behind bending low whispering, ¡°hello 


you¡¯re pretty, aren¡¯t you?¡± goyle gave high-pitched scream terror, threw scales air, sprinted away, vanishing sight long sound scales smashing stopped echoing around corri-dor 
laughing, harry turned contemplate blank wall behind which, sure, draco malfoy standing frozen, aware someone unwelcome there, daring make appearance 
gave harry agreeable feeling power tried remember form words yet tried 
yet hopeful mood last long 
half hour later, tried many variations request see malfoy to, wall doorless ever 
harry felt frustrated beyond belief malfoy might feet away him, still tiniest shred evidence 
losing patience completely, harry ran wall kicked 
¡°ouch!¡± thought might broken toe; clutched hopped one foot, invisibility cloak slipped 
¡°harry?¡± spun around, one-legged, toppled 
there, utter astonishment, tonks, walking toward though frequently strolled corridor 
¡°what¡¯re here?¡± said, scrambling feet again; always find lying floor? ¡°i came see dumbledore,¡± said tonks 
harry thought looked terrible: thinner usual, mouse-colored hair la nk 
¡°his office isn¡¯t here,¡± said harry, ¡°it¡¯s round side castle, behind gargoyle ¡ª ¡± ¡°i know,¡± said tonks 
¡°he¡¯s

¡°hey ¡ª don¡¯t know goes, suppose?¡± ¡°no,¡± said tonks 
¡°what want see about?¡± ¡°nothing particular,¡± said tonks, picking, apparently unconsciously, sleeve robe 
¡°i thought might know what¡¯s going 
i¡¯ve heard rumors 


people getting hurt 
¡± ¡°yeah, know, it¡¯s papers,¡± said harry 
¡°that little kid trying kill ¡ª ¡± ¡°the prophet¡¯s often behind times,¡± said tonks, didn¡¯t seem listening 
¡°you haven¡¯t letters anyone order recently?¡± ¡°no one order writes anymore,¡± said harry, ¡°not since sirius ¡ª ¡± saw eyes filled tears 
¡°i¡¯m sorry,¡± muttered awkwardly 
¡°i mean

¡± ¡°what?¡± said tonks blankly, though heard 
¡°well

¡± turned abruptly walked back corridor, leaving harry stare

malfoy, hand, crack smile 
¡°what mean, ¡®something amusing¡¯?¡± said irritably 
¡°oh, surprise me,¡± said slughom airily 
malfoy opened copy advanced potion-making sulky expression 
could plainer thought lesson waste time 
undoubtedly, harry thought, watching top book, malfoy begrudging time could otherwise spending room requirement 
imagination, malfoy, like tonks, look thinner! certainly looked paler; skin still grayish tinge, probably rarely saw daylight days 
air smugness, excitement, superiority; none swagger hogwarts express, boasted openly mission given voldemort 


could one conclusion, harry¡¯s opinion: mission, whatever was, going badly 
cheered thought, harry skimmed copy advanced potion-making found heavily corrected half-blood prince¡¯s version ¡°an elixir induce euphoria,¡± seemed meet slughorn¡¯s instructions, might (harry¡¯s heart leapt thought struck him) put slughorn good mood would prepared hand memory harry could persuade taste

¡°project defense dark arts, it?¡± harry could tell slughorn knew perfectly well schoolwork 
¡°not exactly, sir,¡± said riddle 
¡°i came across term reading didn¡¯t fully understand 
¡± ¡°no 


well 


you¡¯d hard-pushed find book hogwarts that¡¯ll give details horcruxes, tom, that¡¯s dark stuff, dark indeed,¡± said slughorn 
¡°but obviously know them, sir? mean, wizard like ¡ª sorry, mean, can¡¯t tell me, obviously ¡ª knew anyone could tell me, could ¡ª thought i¡¯d-¡± well done, thought harry, hesitancy, casual tone, careful flattery, none overdone 
he, harry, much experience trying wheedle infonnation reluctant people recognize master work 
could tell riddle wanted information very, much; perhaps working toward moment weeks 
¡°well,¡± said slughom, looking riddle, fiddling ribbon top box crystallized pineapple, ¡°well, can¡¯t hurt give overview, course 
understand term 
horcrux word used object person concealed part soul 
¡± ¡°i don¡¯t quite understand works, though, sir,¡± said riddle 
voice carefully controlled, harry could sense excitement 
¡°well, split soul, see,¡± said slughorn, ¡°and hide part object outside body 
then, even one¡¯s body attacked destroyed, one cannot die, part soul remains earthbound undamaged 
course, existence form 


¡± slughorn¡¯ face crumpled harry found remembering words heard nearly two years before: ¡°i ripped body, less spirit, less meanest ghost 


still, alive 
¡± ¡° 


would want it, tom, 
death would preferable 
¡± riddle¡¯s hunger apparent; expression greedy, could longer hide longing 
¡°how split soul?¡± ¡°well,¡± said slughom uncomfortably, ¡°you must understand soul supposed remain intact whole 
splitting act violation, nature 
¡± ¡°but it?¡± ¡°by act evil ¡ª supreme act evil 
commiting murder

wizard intent upon creating horcrux would use damage advantage: would encase torn portion ¡ª ¡± ¡°encase? ¡ª ?¡± ¡°there spell, ask me, don¡¯t know!¡± said slughoin shaking head like old elephant bothered mosquitoes 
¡°do look though tried ¡ª look like killer?¡± ¡°no, sir, course not,¡± said riddle quickly 
¡°i¡¯m sorry 


didn¡¯t mean offend 


¡± ¡°not all, all, offended,¡± said slughorn gruffly, ¡°it natural feel curiosity things 


wizards certain caliber always drawn aspect magic 


¡± ¡°yes, sir,¡± said riddle 
¡°what don¡¯t understand, though ¡ª curiosity ¡ª mean, would one horcrux much use? split soul once? wouldn¡¯t better, make stronger, soul pieces, mean, instance, isn¡¯t seven powerfully magical number, wouldn¡¯t seven ¡ª ?¡± ¡°merlin¡¯s beard, tom!¡± yelped slughom 
¡°seven! isn¡¯t bad enough think killing one person? case 


bad enough divide soul 


rip seven pieces 


¡± slughorn looked deeply troubled now: gazing riddle though never seen plainly before, harry could tell regretting entering conversation 
¡°of course,¡± muttered, ¡°this hypothetical, we¡¯re discussing, isn¡¯t it? academic 


¡± ¡°yes, sir, course,¡± said riddle quickly 
¡°but same, tom 


keep quiet, i¡¯ve told ¡ª that¡¯s say, we¡¯ve discussed 
people wouldn¡¯t like think we¡¯ve chatting horcruxes 
it¡¯s banned subject hogwarts, know 


dumbledore¡¯s particularly fierce 


¡± ¡°i won¡¯t say word, sir,¡± said riddle, left, harry glimpsed face, full wild happiness worn first found wizard, sort happiness enhance handsome features, made them, somehow, less human 


¡°thank you, harry,¡± said dumbledore quietly 
¡°let us go 


¡± harry landed back office floor dumbledore was; already sitting behind desk 
harry sat waited dumbledore speak 
¡°i hoping piece evidence long time,¡± said dumbledore last 
¡°it confirms theory working, tells right, also far still go 


¡± harry suddenly noticed every single one old headmasters headmistresses portraits around walls awake listening conversation 
corpulent, red nosed wizard actually taken ear trumpet 
¡°well, harry,¡± said dumbledore, ¡°i sure understood significance heard 
age now, give take months, tom riddle could find make immortal 
¡± ¡°you think succeeded then, sir?¡± asked harry 
¡°he made horcrux? that¡¯s didn¡¯t die attacked me? horcrux hidden somewhere? bit soul safe?¡± ¡°a bit 


more,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°you heard voldemort, particularly wanted horace opinion would happen wizard created one horcrux, would happen wizard determined evade death would prepared murder many times, rip soul repeatedly, store many, separately concealed horcrux 
book would given infonnation 
far know ¡ª far, sure, voldemort knew ¡ª wizard ever done tear soul two 
¡± dumbledore paused moment, marshaling thought, said, ¡°four years ago, received considered certain proof voldemort split soul 
¡± ¡°where?¡± asked harry 
¡°how?¡± ¡°you handed me, harry,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°the diary, riddles diary, one giving instructions reopen chamber secrets 
¡± ¡°i don¡¯t understand, sir,¡± said harry 
¡°well, although see riddle came diary, described phenomenon never witnessed 
mere memory starting act think itself? mere memory, sapping life girl whose hands fallen? no, something much sinister lived inside book 


fragment soul, almost sure 
diary horcrux 
raised many questions answered 
intrigued alarmed diary intended weapon much safeguard 
¡± ¡°i still don¡¯t understand,¡± said harry 
¡°well, worked horcrux supposed work ¡ª words, fragment soul concealed inside kept safe undoubtedly played part preventing death owner 
could doubt riddle really wanted diary read, wanted piece soul inhabit possess somebody else, slytherin¡¯s monster would unleashed 
¡± ¡°well, didn¡¯t want hard work wasted,¡± said harry 
¡°he wanted people know slytherin¡¯s heir, couldn¡¯t take credit time 
¡± ¡°quite correct,¡± said dumbledore, nodding 
¡°but don¡¯t see, harry, intended diary passed to, planted on, future hogwarts student, remarkably blase precious fragment soul concealed within 
point horcrux is, professor slughom explained, keep part self hidden safe, fling somebody else¡¯s path run risk might destroy ¡ª indeed happened: particular fragment soul more; saw 
¡°the careless way voldemort regarded horcrux seemed ominous 
suggested must made ¡ª planning make ¡ª horcruxes, loss first would detrimental 
wish believe it, nothing else seemed make sense 
told me, two years later, night voldemort returned body, made illuminating alanning statement death eaters 
7 gone anybody along path leads immortality 
¡¯ told said 
¡®further anybody! ¡¯ thought knew meant, though death eaters 
referring horcruxes, horcruxes plural, harry, don¡¯t believe wizard ever 
yet fitted: lord voldomort seemed grow less human passing years, transformation undergone seemed explainable soul mutitated beyond realms might call ¡®usual evil¡¯ 


¡± ¡°so he¡¯s made impossible kill murdering people?¡± said harry 
¡°why couldn¡¯t make sorcerer¡¯s stone, steal one, interested immortality?¡± ¡°well, know tried that, five years ago,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°but several reasons why, think, sorcerer¡¯s stone would appeal less horcruxes lord voldemort 
¡°while elixir life indeed extend life, must drunk regularly, eternity, drinker maintain immortality 
therefore, voldemort would entirely dependant elixir, ran out, contaminated, stone stolen, would die like man 
voldemort likes operate alone, remember 
believe would found thought dependent, even elixir, intolerable 
course prepared drink would take horrible part-life condemned attacking you, regain body 
thereafter, convinced, intended continue rely horcruxes 
would need nothing more, could regain human form 
already immortal, see 


close immortal man 
¡°but now, harry, anned infonnation, crucial memory succeeded procuring us, closer secret finishing lord voldemort anyone ever 
heard him, harry: ¡®wouldn¡¯t better, make stronger, soul pieces 


isn¡¯t seven powerfully magical number 


¡¯ ¡¯t seven powerfully magical number 
yes, think idea seven-part soul would greatly appeal lord voldemort 
¡± ¡°he made seven horcruxes?¡± said harry, horror-struck, several portraits walls made similar noises shock mid outrage 
¡°but could anywhere world ¡ª hidden ¡ª buried invisible ¡ª ¡± ¡°i glad see appreciate magnitude problem,¡± said dumbledore calmly 
¡°but firstly, no, harry, seven horcruxes: six 
seventh part soul, however maimed, resides inside regenerated body 
part lived spectral existence many years exile; without that, self 
seventh piece soul last anybody wishing kill voldemort must attack ¡ª piece lives body 
¡± ¡°but six horcruxes, then,¡± said harry, little desperately, ¡°how supposed find them?¡± ¡°you forgetting 


already destroyed one 
destroyed another 
¡± ¡°you have?¡± said harry eagerly 
¡°yes indeed,¡± said dumbledore, raised blackened, burned-looking hand 
¡°the ring, harry 
marvolo¡¯s ring 
terrible curse upon 
¡ª forgive lack seemly modesty ¡ª prodigious skill, professor snape¡¯s timely action returned hogwarts, desperately injured, might lived tell tale 
however, withered hand seem unreasonable exchange seventh voldemort¡¯s soul 
ring longer horcrux 
¡± ¡°but find it?¡± ¡°well, know, many years made business discover much voldemort¡¯ past life 
traveled widely, visiting places knew 
stumbled across ring hidden ruin gaunt¡¯s house 
seems voldemort succeeded sealing piece soul inside it, want wear anymore 
hid it, protected many powerful enchantments, shack ancestors lived (morfin carted azkaban, course), never guessing might one day take trouble visit ruin, might keeping eye open traces magical concealment 
¡°however, congratulate heartily 
destroyed diary ring, right theory seven-part soul, four horcruxes remain 
¡± ¡°and could anything?¡± said harry 
¡°they could oh, tin cans or, dunno, empty potion bottles 


¡± ¡°you thinking portkeys, harry, must ordinary objects, easy overlook 
would lord voldemort use tin cans old potion bottles guard precious soul? forgetting showed 
lord voldemort liked collect trophies, preferred objects powerful magical history 
pride, belief superiority, determination carve startling place magical history; things, suggest voldemort would chosen horcruxes care, favoring objects worthy honor 
¡± ¡°the diary wasn¡¯t special 
¡± ¡°the diary, said yourself, proof hire slytherin 
sure voldemort considered stupendous importance 
¡± ¡°so, horcruxes?¡± said harry 
¡°do think know are, sir?¡± ¡°i guess,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°for reasons already given, believe lord voldemort would prefer objects that, themselves, certain grandeur 
therefore trawled back voldemort¡¯s past see find evidence artifacts disappeared around 
¡± ¡°the locket!¡± said harry loudly, ¡°hufflepuff cup!¡± ¡°yes,¡± said dumbledore, smiling, ¡°i would prepared bet ¡ª perhaps hand ¡ª couple fingers, became horcruxes three four 
remaining two, assuming created total six, problem, hazard guess that, secured objects hufflepuff slytherin, set track objects owned gryffindor ravenclaw 
four objects four founders would, sure, exerted powerful pull voldemort¡¯s imagination 
cannot answer whether ever managed find anything ravenclaw¡¯s 
confident, however, known relic gryffindor remains safe 
¡± dumbledore pointed blackened fingers wall behind him, ruby-encrusted sword reposed within glass case 
¡°do think that¡¯s really wanted come back hogwarts, sir?¡± said harry 
¡°to try find something one founders?¡± ¡°my thoughts precisely,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°but unfortunately, advance us much further, turned away, believe, without chance search school 
forced conclude never fulfilled ambition collecting four founders¡¯ objects 
definitely two ¡ª may found three ¡ª best 
¡± ¡°even got something ravenclaw¡¯s gryffindor¡¯s, leaves sixth horcrux,¡± said harry, counting fingers 
¡°unless he¡¯s got both?¡± ¡°i don¡¯t think so,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°i think know sixth horcrux 
wonder say confess curious behavior snake, nagini?¡± ¡°the snake?¡± said harry, startled 
¡°you use animals horcruxes?¡± ¡°well, inadvisable so,¡± said dumbledore, ¡°because confide part soul something think move obviously risky business 
however, calculations correct, voldemort still least one horcrux short goal six entered parents¡¯ house intention killing 
seems reserved process making horcruxes particularly significant deaths 
would certainly 
believed killing you, destroying danger prophecy outlined 
believed making invincible 
sure intending make final horcrux death 
know, failed 
interval years, however, used nagini kill old muggle man, might occurred turn last horcrux 
underlines slytherin connection, enhances lord voldemorts mystique; think perhaps fond anything; certainly likes keep close, seems unusual amount control her, even parsehnouth 
¡± ¡°so,¡± said harry, ¡°the diary¡¯s gone, ring¡¯s gone 
cup, locket, snake still intact, think might horcrux ravenclaw¡¯s gryffindor¡¯s?¡± ¡°an admirably succinct accurate summary, yes,¡± said dumbledore, bowing head 
¡°so 


still looking them, sir? you¡¯ve going you¡¯ve leaving school?¡± ¡°correct,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°i looking long time 
think 


perhaps 


may close finding another one 
hopeful signs 
¡± ¡°and do,¡± said harry quickly, ¡°can come help get rid it?¡± dumbledore looked harry intently moment saying, ¡°yes, think 
¡± ¡°i can?¡± said harry, thoroughly taken aback 
¡°oh yes,¡± said dumbledore, smiling slightly 
¡°i think earned right 
¡± harry felt heart lift 
good hear words caution protection 
headmasters head-mistresses around walls seemed less impressed dumbledore ¡¯s decision; harry saw shaking heads phineas nigellus actually snorted 
¡°does voldemort know horcrux destroyed, sir? feel it?¡± harry asked, ignoring portraits 
¡°a interesting question, harry 
believe 
believe voldemort immersed evil, crucial parts detached long, feel 
perhaps, point death, might aware loss 


aware, instance, diary destroyed forced truth lucius malfoy 
voldemort discovered diary mutilated robbed powers, told anger terrible behold 
¡± ¡°but thought meant lucius malfoy smuggle hogwarts?¡± ¡°yes, did, years ago, sure would able create horcruxes, still lucius supposed wait voldemorts say-so, never received it, voldemort vanished shortly giving diary 
doubt thought lucius would dare anything horcrux guard carefully, counting much upon lucius¡¯s fear master gone years lucius believed dead 
course, lucius know diary really 
understand voldemort told diary would cause chamber secrets reopen cleverly enchanted 
lucius known held portion masters soul hands, would undoubtedly treated reverence ¡ª instead went ahead carried old plan ends 
planting diary upon arthur weasleys daughter, hoped discredit arthur get rid highly incriminating magical object one stroke 
ah, poor lucius 


voldemorts fury fact threw away horcrux gain, fiasco ministry last year, would surprised secretly glad safe azkaban moment 
¡± harry sat thought moment, asked, ¡°so horcruxes destroyed, voldemort could killed?¡± ¡°yes, think so,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°without horcruxes, voldemort mortal man maimed diminished soul 
never forget, though, soul may damaged beyond repair, brain magical powers remain intact 
take uncommon skill power kill wizard like voldemort even without horcruxes 
¡± ¡°but haven¡¯t got uncommon skill power,¡± said harry, could stop 
¡°yes, have,¡± said dumbledore firmly 
¡°you power voldemort never 
¡ª ¡± ¡°i know!¡± said harry impatiently 
¡°i love!¡± difficulty stopped adding, ¡°big deal!¡± ¡°yes, harry, love,¡± said dumbledore, looked though knew perfectly well harry refrained saying 
¡°which, given everything happened you, great remarkable thing 
still young understand unusual are, harry 
¡± ¡°so, prophecy says i¡¯ll ¡®power dark lord knows not,¡¯ means ¡ª love?¡± asked harry, feeling little let 
¡°yes ¡ª love,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°but harry, never forget prophecy says significant voldemort made 
told end last year 
voldemort singled person would dangerous ¡ª so, made person would dangerous him!¡± ¡°but comes ¡ª ¡± ¡°no, doesn¡¯t!¡± said dumbledore, sounding impatient 
pointing harry black, withered hand, said, ¡°you setting much store prophecy!¡± ¡°but,¡± spluttered harry, ¡°but said prophecy means 55 ¡°if voldemort never heard prophecy, would fulfilled? would meant anything? course not! think every prophecy hall prophecy fulfilled?¡± ¡°but,¡± said harry, bewildered, ¡°but last year, said one us would kill ¡ª ¡± ¡°harry, harry, voldemort made grave error, acted professor trelawney¡¯s words! voldemort never murdered father, would imparted furious desire revenge? course not! forced mother die you, would given magical protection could penetrate? course not, harry! don¡¯t see? voldemort created worst enemy, tyrants everywhere do! idea much tyrants fear people oppress? realize that, one day, amongst many victims, sure one rises strikes back! voldemort different! always lookout one would challenge 
heard prophecy leapt action, result handpicked man likely finish him, handed uniquely deadly weapons!¡± ¡°but ¡ª ¡± ¡°it essential understand this!¡± said dumbledore, standing striding room, glittering robes swooshing wake; harry never seen agitated 
¡°by attempting kill you, voldemort singled remarkable person sits front me, gave tools job! voldemort¡¯s fault able see thoughts, ambitions, even understand snakelike language gives orders, yet, harry, despite privileged insight voldemort¡¯s world (which, incidentally, gift death eater would kill have), never seduced dark arts, never, even second, shown slightest desire become one voldemort¡¯s followers!¡± ¡°of course haven¡¯t!¡± said harry indignantly 
¡°he killed mum dad!¡± ¡°you protected, short, ability love!¡± said dumbledore loudly 
¡°the protection possibly work lure power like voldemort¡¯s! spite temptation endured, suffering, remain pure heart, pure age eleven, stared mirror reflected heart¡¯s desire, showed way thwart lord voldemort, immortality riches 
harry, idea wizards could seen saw mirror? voldemort known dealing with, not! ¡°but knows 
flitted lord voldemort¡¯s mind without damage yourself, cannot possess without enduring mortal agony, discovered ministry 
think understands why, harry, then, hurry mutilate soul, never paused understand incomparable power soul untarnished whole 
¡± ¡°but, sir,¡± said harry, making valiant efforts sound argumentative, ¡°it comes thing, doesn¡¯t it? i¡¯ve got try kill him, ¡ª ¡± ¡°got to?¡± said dumbledore 
¡°of course you¡¯ve got to! prophecy! you, yourself, never rest you¡¯ve tried! know it! imagine, please, moment, never heard prophecy! would feel voldemort now? think!¡± harry watched dumbledore striding front him, thought 
thought mother, father, sirius 
thought cedric diggory 
thought terrible deeds knew lord voldemort done 
flame seemed leap inside chest, searing throat 
¡°i¡¯d want finished,¡± said harry quietly 
¡°and i¡¯d want 
¡± ¡°of course would!¡± cried dumbledore 
¡°you see, prophecy mean anything! prophecy caused lord voldemort mark equal 


words, free choose way, quite free turn back prophecy! voldemort continues set store prophecy 
continue hunt 


makes certain, really, ¡ª ¡± ¡°that one us going end killing other,¡± said harry

harry, laughing others, glad innocent reason look ginny; received several bludger injuries practice keeping eyes snitch 
battle still raged inside head: ginny ronl sometimes thought post- lavender ron might mind much asked ginny out, remembered ron¡¯s expression seen kissing dean, sure ron would consider base treachery harry much held hand 


yet harry could help talking ginny, laughing her, walking back practice her; however much conscience ached, found wondering best get

ron unique respect; interest gryffindor-ravenclaw game running extremely high throughout school, match would decide championship, still wide open 
gryffindor beat ravenclaw margin three hundred points (a tall order, yet harry never known team fly better) would win championship 
less three hundred points, would come second ravenclaw; lost hundred points would third behind hufflepuff lost hundred, would fourth place nobody, harry thought, would ever, ever let forget captained gryffindor first bottom-of-the-table defeat two centuries

moaning myrtle let deafening scream: ¡°murder! murder bathroom! murder!¡± door banged open behind harry looked up, terrified: snape burst room, face livid 
pushing harry roughly aside, knelt malfoy, drew wand, traced deep wounds harry¡¯s curse made, muttering incantation sounded almost like song 
flow blood seemed ease; snape wiped residue malfoy¡¯s face repeated spell 
wounds seemed knitting 
harry still watching, horrified done, barely aware soaked blood water 
moaning myrtle still sobbing wailing overhead 
snape performed countercurse third time, half-lifted malfoy standing position

staring snape again, midst wrecked, soaked bathroom

harry turned splashed bathroom 
corridor, broke run toward gryffindor tower 
people walking way; gaped him, drenched water blood, answered none questions fired ran past 
felt stunned; though beloved pet turned suddenly savage; prince thinking copy spell book? would happen snape saw it? would tell slughorn ¡ª harry¡¯s stomach churned ¡ª harry achieving good results potions year? would confiscate destroy book taught harry much

alleyways roads bordered tetering piles broken damaged furniture, stowed away, perhaps, hide evidence mishandled magic, else hidden castle-proud house-elves 
thousands thousands books, doubt banned graffitied stolen 
winged catapults fanged frisbees, still enough life hover halfheartedly mountains forbidden items; chipped bottles congealed potions, hats, jewels, cloaks; looked like dragon eggshells, corked bottles whose contents still shimmered evilly, several rusting swords, heavy, bloodstained axe 
harry hurried forward one many alleyways hidden treasure 
turned right past enormous stuffed troll, ran short way, took left broken vanishing cabinet montague got lost previous year, finally pausing beside large cupboard seemed acid thrown blistered surface 
opened one cupboard¡¯s creaking doors: already used hiding place something cage long since died; skeleton five legs 
stuffed half-blood princes book behind cage slammed door

would able find spot amidst junk? seizing chipped bust ugly old warlock top nearby crate, stood top cupboard book hidden, perched dusty old wig tarnished tiara statues head make distinctive, sprinted back alleyways hidden junk fast could go, back door, back onto corridor, slammed door behind him, turned back stone 
harry ran flat-out toward bathroom floor below, cramming ron¡¯s copy advanced potion-making bag 
minute later, back front snape, held hand wordlessly harry¡¯s schoolbag 
harry handed over, panting, searing pain chest, waited 
one one, snape extracted harry¡¯s books examined 
finally, book left potions book, looked carefully speaking 
¡°this copy advanced potion-making, it, potter?¡± ¡°yes,¡± said harry, still breathing hard

¡°leave it, hennione,¡± said ron angrily 
harry never made dinner; appetite 
finished telling ron, hennione, ginny happened, seemed much need 
news traveled fast: apparently moaning myrtle taken upon pop every bathroom castle tell story; malfoy already visited hospital wing pansy parkinson, lost time vilifying harry far wide, snape told staff precisely happened 
harry already called common room endure fifteen highly unpleasant minutes company professor mcgonagall, told lucky expelled supported wholeheartedly snape¡¯s punishment detention every saturday end tenn 
¡°i told something wrong prince person,¡± hermione said, evidently unable stop

¡°ah, potter,¡± said snape, harry knocked door entered unpleasantly familiar office snape, despite teaching floors now, vacated; dimly lit ever slimy dead objects suspended colored potions around walls 
ominously, many cob-webbed boxes piled table harry clearly supposed sit; aura tedious, hard, pointless work 
¡°mr

¡°they records hogwarts wrongdoers punishments

peeves vanished, silence corridors; fifteen minutes left curfew, people already returned common rooms 
harry heard scream crash 
stopped tracks, listening 
¡°how - dare - - aaaaargh!¡± noise coming corridor nearby; harry sprinted towards it, wand ready, hurtled round another comer saw professor trelawney sprawled upon floor, head covered one many shawls, several sherry bottles lying beside her, one broken 
¡°professor ¡ª ¡± harry hurried forwards helped professor trelawney feet

¡°perhaps horse heard people say inherited great-great-grandmother¡¯s gift

harry standing stock-still waves shock crashed him, wave wave, obliterating everything except information kept long

¡± off, hurrying back portrait hole towards entrance hall 
dumbledore waiting beside oaken front doors 
turned hany came skidding topmost stone step, panting hard, searing stitch side 
¡°i would like wear cloak, please,¡± said dumbledore, waited hany thrown saying, ¡°very good

harry hurried alongside invisibility cloak, still panting sweating rather lot 
¡°but people think see leaving, professor?¡± harry asked, mind malfoy snape 
¡°that hogsmeade drink,¡± said dumbledore lightly 
¡°i sometimes offer rosmerta custom, else visit hog¡¯s head 


appear 
good way disguising one¡¯s true destination 
¡± made way drive gathering twilight 
air full smells warm grass, lake water wood smoke hagrid¡¯s cabin 
difficult believe heading anything dangerous frightening 
¡°professor,¡± said harry quietly, gates bottom drive came view, ¡°will apparating?¡± ¡°yes,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°you apparate now, believe?¡± ¡°yes,¡± said harry, ¡°but haven¡¯t got licence 
¡± felt best honest; spoiled everything turning hundred miles supposed go? ¡°no matter,¡± said dumbledore, ¡°i assist 
¡± turned gates twilit, deserted lane hogsmeade 
darkness descended fast walked time reached high street night falling earnest 
lights twinkled windows shops neared three broomsticks heard raucous shouting 
¡° ¡ª stay out!¡± shouted madam rosmerta, forcibly ejecting grubby-looking wizard 
¡°oh, hello, albus 


you¡¯re late¡± ¡°good evening, rosmerta, good evening 


forgive me, i¡¯m hog¡¯s head

¡± minute later turned corner side street hog¡¯s head¡¯s sign creaked little, though breeze 
contrast three broomsticks, pub appeared completely empty 
¡°it necessary us enter,¡± muttered dumbledore, glancing around 
¡°as long nobody sees us go 


place hand upon ann, harry 
need grip hard, merely guiding 
count three ¡ª one 


two 


three 


¡± harry turned 
once, horrible sensation squeezed thick rubber tube; could draw breath, every part com-pressed almost past endurance then, thought must suffocate, invisible bands seemed burst open, standing cool darkness, breathing lungfuls fresh, salty air 
chapter twenty-six cave harry could smell salt hear rushing waves; light, chilly breeze ruffled hair looked moon-lit sea star-strewn sky 
standing upon high outcrop dark rock, water foaming churning 
glanced shoulder 
towering cliff stood behind them, sheer drop, black faceless 
large chunks rock, one upon harry dumbledore standing, looked though broken away cliff face point past 
bleak, harsh view, sea rock unrelieved tree sweep grass sand 
¡°what think?¡± asked dumbledore 
might asking harry¡¯s opinion whether good site picnic 
¡°they brought kids orphanage here?¡± asked harry, could imagine less cozy spot day trip 
¡°not here, precisely,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°there village sorts halfway along cliffs behind us 
believe orphans taken little sea air view waves 
no, think ever tom riddle youthful victims visited spot 
muggle could reach rock unless uncommonly good mountaineers, boats cannot approach cliffs, waters around dangerous 
imagine riddle climbed down; magic would served better ropes 
brought two small children him, probably pleasure terrorizing 
think journey alone would done it, don¡¯t you?¡± harry looked cliff felt goose bumps 
¡°but final destination ¡ª ¡ª lies little farther 
come 
¡± dumbledore beckoned harry edge rock series jagged niches made footholds leading boulders lay half-submerged water closer cliff 
treacherous descent dumbledore, hampered slightly withered hand, moved slowly 
lower rocks slippery seawater 
harry could feel flecks cold salt spray hitting face 
¡°lumos,¡± said dumbledore, reached boulder closest cliff face 
thousand flecks golden light sparkled upon dark surface water feet crouched; black wall rock beside illuminated 
¡°you see?¡± said dumbledore quietly, holding wand little higher 
harry saw fissure cliff dark water swirling 
¡°you object getting little wet?¡± ¡°no,¡± said harry 
¡°then take invisibility cloak ¡ª need ¡ª let us take plunge,¡± sudden agility much younger man, dumbledore slid boulder, landed sea, began swim, perfect breaststroke, toward dark slit rock face, lit wand held teeth 
harry pulled cloak, stuffed pocket, followed 
water icy; harry¡¯s waterlogged clothes billowed around weighed 
taking deep breaths filled nostrils tang salt seaweed, struck shimmering, shrinking light moving deeper cliff 
fissure soon opened dark tunnel harry could tell would filled water high tide 
slimy walls barely three feet apart glimmered like wet tar passing light dumbledore¡¯ wand 
little way in, passageway curved left, harry saw extended far cliff 
continued swim dumbledore¡¯s wake, tips benumbed fingers brushing rough, wet rock 
saw dumbledore rising water ahead, silver hair dark robes gleaming 
harry reached spot found steps led large cave 
clambered them, water streaming soaking clothes, emerged, shivering uncontrollably, still freezing air 
dumbledore standing middle cave, wand held high turned slowly spot, examining walls ceiling 
¡°yes, place,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°how tell?¡± harry spoke whisper 
¡°it known magic,¡± said dumbledore simply 
harry could tell whether shivers experiencing due spine-deep coldness awareness enchantments 
watched dumbledore continued revolve spot, evidently concentrating things harry could see 
¡°this merely antechamber, entrance hall,¡± said dumbledore moment two 
¡°we need penetrate inner place 


lord voldemort¡¯s obstacles stand way, rather nature made 


¡± dumbledore approached wall cave caressed blackened fingertips, murmuring words strange tongue harry understand 
twice dumbledore walked right around cave, touching much rough rock could, occasionally pausing, running fingers backward forward particular spot, finally stopped, hand pressed flat wall 
¡°here,¡± said 
¡°we go 
entrance concealed 
¡± harry ask dumbledore knew 
never seen wizard work things like this, simply looking touching; harry long since learned bangs smoke often marks ineptitude expertise 
dumbledore stepped back cave wall pointed wand rock 
moment, arched outline appeared there, blazing white though powerful light behind crack 
¡°you¡¯ve d-done it!¡± said harry chattering teeth, words left lips outline gone, leaving rock bare solid ever 
dumbledore looked around 
¡°harry, i¡¯m sorry, forgot,¡± said; pointed wand harry once, harry¡¯s clothes warm dry hanging front blazing fire 
¡°thank you,¡± said harry gratefully, dumbledore already turned attention back solid cave wall 
try magic, simply stood staring intently, though something extremely interesting written 
harry stayed quite still; want break dumbledores concentration 
then, two solid minutes, dumbledore said quietly, ¡°oh, surely 
crude 
¡± ¡°what it, professor?¡± ¡°i rather think,¡± said dumbledore, putting uninjured hand inside robes drawing short silver knife kind harry used chop potion ingredients, ¡°that required make payment pass 
¡± ¡°payment?¡± said harry 
¡°you¡¯ve got give door something?¡± ¡°yes,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°blood, much mistaken 
¡± ¡°blood?¡± ¡°i said crude,¡± said dumbledore, sounded disdainful, even disappointed, though voldemort fallen short higher standards dumbledore expected 
¡°the idea, sure gathered, enemy must weaken ¡ª enter 
again, lord voldemort fails grasp much terrible things physical injury 
¡± ¡°yeah, still, avoid 


¡± said harry, experienced enough pain keen 
¡°sometimes, however, unavoidable,¡± said dumbledore, shaking back sleeve robes exposing foreann injured hand 
¡°professor!¡± protested harry, hurrying forward dumbledore raised knife 
¡°til it, i¡¯m know going say ¡ª younger, fitter? dumbledore merely smiled 
flash silver, spurt scarlet; rock face peppered dark, glistening drops 
¡°you kind, harry,¡± said dumbledore, passing tip wand deep cut made arm, healed instantly, snape healed malfoy¡¯s wound, ¡°but blood worth mine 
ah, seems done trick, doesn¡¯t it?¡± blazing silver outline arch appeared wall more, time fade away: blood-spattered rock within simply vanished, leaving opening seemed total darkness 
¡°after me, think,¡± said dumbledore, walked archway harry heels, lighting wand hastily went 
eerie sight met eyes: standing edge great black lake, vast harry could make distant banks, cavern high ceiling sight 
misty greenish light shone far away looked like middle lake; reflected completely still water 
greenish glow light two wands things broke otherwise velvety blackness, though rays penetrate far harry would expected 
darkness somehow denser nonnal darkness 
¡°let us walk,¡± said dumbledore quietly 
¡°be careful step water 
stay close 
¡± set around edge lake, harry followed close behind 
footsteps made echoing, slapping sounds narrow rim rock surrounded water 
walked, view vary: one side them, rough cavern wall, other, boundless expanse smooth, glassy blackness, middle mysterious greenish glow 
harry found place silence oppressive, unnerving 
¡°professor?¡± said finally 
¡°do think horcrux here?¡± ¡°oh yes,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°yes, i¡¯m sure 
question is, get it?¡± ¡°we couldn¡¯t 


couldn¡¯t try summoning charm?¡± harry said, sure stupid suggestion 
much keener prepared admit getting place soon possible 
¡°certainly could,¡± said dumbledore, stopping suddenly harry almost walked 
¡°why don¡¯t it?¡± ¡°me? oh 


okay 


¡± harry expected this, cleared throat said loudly, wand aloft, ¡°accio horcrux!¡± noise like explosion, something large pale erupted dark water twenty feet away; harry could see was, vanished crashing splash made great, deep ripples mirrored surface 
harry leapt backward shock hit wall; heart still thundering turned dumbledore 
¡°what that?¡± ¡°something, think, ready respond attempt seize horcrux 
¡± harry looked back water 
surface lake shining black glass: ripples vanished unnaturally fast; harry¡¯s heart, however, still pounding 
¡°did think would happen, sir?¡± ¡°i thought something would happen made obvious attempt get hands horcrux 
good idea, harry; much simplest way finding facing 
¡± ¡°but don¡¯t know thing was,¡± said harry, looking sinisterly smooth water 
¡°what things are, mean,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°i doubt much one 
shall walk on?¡± ¡°professor?¡± ¡°yes, harry?¡± ¡°do think we¡¯re going go lake?¡± ¡°into it? unfortunate 
¡± ¡°you don¡¯t think horcrux bottom?¡± ¡°oh 


think horcrux middle 
¡± dumbledore pointed toward misty green light center lake 
¡°so we¡¯re going cross lake get it?¡± ¡°yes, think 
¡± harry say anything 
thoughts water monsters, giant serpents, demons, kelpies, sprites 


¡°aha,¡± said dumbledore, stopped again; time, harry really walk him; moment toppled edge dark water, dumbledore ¡¯s uninjured hand closed tightly around upper ann, pulling back 
¡°so sorry, harry, given warning 
stand back wall, please; think found place 
¡± harry idea dumbledore meant; patch dark bank exactly like every bit far could tell, dumbledore seemed detected something special 
time running hand, rocky wall, hrough thin air, though expecting find grip something invisible 
¡°oho,¡± said dumbledore happily, seconds later 
hand closed midair upon something harry could see 
dumbledore moved closer water; harry watched nervously tips dumbledore ¡¯s buckled shoes found utmost edge rock rim 
keeping hand clenched midair, dumbledore raised wand tapped fist point 
immediately thick coppery green chain appeared thin air, extending depths water dumbledore ¡¯s clenched hand 
dumbledore tapped chain, began slide fist like snake, coiling ground clinking sound echoed noisily rocky walls, pulling something depths black water 
harry gasped ghostly prow tiny boat broke surface, glowing green chain, floated, barely ripple, toward place bank harry dumbledore stood 
¡°how kn ow there?¡± harry asked astonishment 
¡°magic always leaves traces,¡± said dumbledore, boat hit bank gentle bump, ¡°sometimes distinctive traces 
taught tom riddle 
know style 
¡± ¡°is 


boat safe?¡± ¡°oh yes, think 
voldemort needed create means cross lake without attracting wrath creatures placed within case ever wanted visit remove horcrux 
¡± ¡°so things water won¡¯t anything us cross voldemort¡¯ boat?¡± ¡°i think must resign fact will, point, realize lord voldemort 
thus far, however, done well 
allowed us raise boat 
¡± ¡°but let us?¡± asked harry, could shake vision tentacles rising dark water moment sight bank 
¡°voldemort would reasonably confident none great wizard would able find boat,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°i think would prepared risk was, mind, unlikely possibility somebody else would find it, knowing set obstacles ahead would able penetrate 
shall see whether right 
¡± harry looked boat 
really small 
¡°it doesn¡¯t look like built two people 
hold us? heavy together?¡± dumbledore chuckled 
¡°voldemort cared weight, amount magical power crossed lake 
rather think enchantment placed upon boat one wizard time able sail 
¡± ¡°but ¡ª ?¡± ¡°i think count, harry: underage unqualified 
voldemort would never expected sixteen-year-old reach place: think unlikely powers register compared mine 
¡± words nothing raise harrys morale; perhaps dumbledore knew it, added, ¡°voldemort¡¯ mistake, harry, voldemort¡¯ mistake 


age foolish forgetful underestimates youth 


now, first time, careful touch water 
¡± dumbledore stood aside harry climbed carefully boat 
dumbledore stepped too, coiling chain onto floor 
crammed together; harry could comfortably sit, crouched, knees jutting edge boat, began move 
sound silken rustle boat¡¯s prow cleaving water; moved without help, though invisible rope pulling onward toward light center 
soon could longer see walls cavern; might sea except waves 
harry looked saw reflected gold wandlight sparkling glittering black water passed 
boat carving deep ripples upon glassy surface, grooves dark mirror 


harry saw it, marble white, floating inches surface 
¡°professor!¡± said, startled voice echoed loudly silent water 
¡°harry?¡± ¡°i think saw hand water ¡ª human hand!¡± ¡°yes, sure did,¡± said dumbledore calmly 
harry stared water, looking vanished hand, sick feeling rose throat 
¡°so thing jumped water ¡ª ?¡± harry answer dumbledore could reply; wandlight slid fresh patch water showed him, time, dead man lying faceup inches beneath surface, open eyes misted though cobwebs, hair robes swirling around like smoke 
¡°there bodies here!¡± said harry, voice sounded much higher usual unlike 
¡°yes,¡± said dumbledore placidly, ¡°but need worry moment 
¡± ¡°at moment?¡± harry repeated, tearing gaze water look dumbledore 
¡°not merely drifting peacefully us,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°there nothing feared body, harry, anything feared darkness 
lord voldemort, course secretly fears both, disagrees 
reveals lack wisdom 
unknown fear look upon death darkness, nothing 
¡± harry said nothing; want argue, found idea bodies floating around beneath horrible and, more, believe dangerous 
¡°but one jumped,¡± said, trying make voice level calm dumbledore¡¯s 
¡°when tried summon horcrux, body leapt lake 
¡± ¡°yes,¡± said dumbledore 
¡°i sure take horcrux, shall find less peaceable 
however, like many creatures dwell cold darkness, fear light wannth, shall therefore call aid need arise 
fire, harry,¡± dumbledore added smile, response harry¡¯s bewildered expression 
¡°oh 


right 


¡± said harry quickly 
turned head look greenish glow toward boat still inexorably sailing 
could pretend scared 
great black lake, teeming dead 


seemed hours hours ago met professor trelawney, given ron hermione felix felicis 


suddenly wished said better good-bye

¡°i suppose he¡¯s gotta keep cover 
look, let¡¯s get yeh back ter school 
come on, harry 


¡± harry attempt argue explain 
still shaking uncontrollably 
hagrid would find soon enough, soon 


directed steps back toward castle, harry saw many windows lit 
could imagine, clearly, scenes inside people moved room room, telling death eaters got in, mark shining hogwarts, somebody must killed 


oak front doors stood open ahead them, light flooding onto drive lawn 
slowly, uncertainly, dressing-gowned people creeping steps, looking around nervously sign death eaters fled night 
harry¡¯s eyes, however, fixed upon ground foot tallest tower 
imagined could see black, huddled mass lying grass there, though really far away see anything sort 
even stared wordlessly place thought dumbledore ¡¯s body must lie, however, saw people beginning move toward 
¡°what¡¯re lookin¡¯ at?¡± said hagrid, harry approached castle front, fang keeping close could ankles 
¡°wha¡¯s lyin¡¯ grass?¡± hagrid added sharply, heading toward foot astronomy tower, small crowd congregating 
¡°see it, harry? right foot tower? mark 


blimey

harry walked alongside him, feeling aches pains face legs various hexes last half hour hit him, though oddly detached way, though somebody near suffering 
real inescapable awful pressing feeling chest 


hagrid moved, dreamlike, murmuring crowd front, dumbstruck students teachers left gap 
harry heard hagrid¡¯s moan pain shock, stop; walked slowly forward reached place dumbledore lay crouched beside 
known hope moment full body-bind curse dumbledore placed upon lifted, known could happened caster dead, still preparation seeing here, spread-eagled, broken: greatest wizard harry ever, would ever, meet 
dumbledore¡¯ eyes closed; strange angle arms legs, might sleeping 
harry reached out, straightened half-moon spectacles upon crooked nose, wiped trickle blood mouth sleeve 
gazed wise old face tried absorb enonnous incomprehensible truth: never would dumbledore speak him, never could help 


crowd murmured behind harry 
seemed like long time, became aware kneeling upon something hard looked 
locket managed steal many hours fallen dumbledore¡¯ pocket 
opened, perhaps due force hit ground 
although could feel shock horror sadness felt already, harry knew, picked up, something wrong 


turned locket hands 
neither large locket remembered seeing pensieve, markings upon it, sign ornate supposed slytherins mark 
moreover, nothing inside scrap folded parchment wedged tightly place portrait 
automatically, without really thinking doing, harry pulled fragment parchment, opened it, read light many wands lit behind him: dark lord know dead long read want know discovered secret 
stolen real horcrux intend destroy soon

¡°and dumbledore believed that?¡± said lupin incredulously 
¡°dumbledore believed snape sorry james dead? snape hated james 


¡± ¡°and didn¡¯t think mother worth damn either,¡± said harry, ¡°because muggle-bom

¡°this fault,¡± said professor mcgonagall suddenly 
looked disoriented, twisting wet handkerchief hands 
¡°my fault 
sent filius fetch snape tonight, actually sent come help us! hadn¡¯t alerted snape going on, might never joined forces death eaters 
don¡¯t think knew filius told him, don¡¯t think knew coming

¡°we wanted help, glad think snape way 


¡± ¡°so arrived fight, joined death eaters¡¯ side?¡± asked harry, wanted every detail snape¡¯s duplicity infamy, feverishly collecting reasons hate him, swear vengeance 
¡°i don¡¯t know exactly happened,¡± said professor mcgonagall distractedly 
¡°it¡¯s confusing 


dumbledore told us would leaving school hours patrol corridors case 


remus, bill, nymphadora join us 


patrolled 
seemed quiet 
every secret passageway school covered 
knew nobody could fly 
powerful enchantments every entrance castle

¡± ¡°i do,¡± said harry, explained, briefly, pair vanishing cabinets magical pathway formed 
¡°so got room requirement

¡°i messed up, harry,¡± said ron bleakly 
¡°we like told us: checked marauder¡¯s map couldn¡¯t see malfoy it, thought must room requirement, me, ginny, neville went keep watch 


malfoy got past us

¡°nothing would penetrate darkness; could grope way corridor again, meanwhile could hear people rushing past us 
obviously malfoy could see hand thing guiding them, didn¡¯t dare use curses anything case hit other, time we¡¯d reached corridor light, they¡¯d gone 
¡± ¡°luckily,¡± said lupin hoarsely, ¡°ron, ginny, neville ran us almost immediately told us happened 
found death eaters minutes later, heading direction astronomy tower 
malfoy obviously hadn¡¯t expected people watch; seemed exhausted supply darkness powder, rate 
fight broke out, scattered gave chase 
one them, gibbon, broke away headed tower stairs ¡°to set mark?¡± asked harry 
¡°he must done, yes, must arranged left room requirement,¡± said lupin

several minutes harry became aware heading professor mcgonagall¡¯s office, dumbledore¡¯s, another seconds realized course, deputy headmistress 



apparently headmistress

silence ascended moving spiral staircase entered circular office 
know expected: room would draped black, perhaps, even dumbledore¡¯s body might lying 
fact, looked almost exactly done dumbledore left mere hours previously: silver instruments whirring puffing spindle legged tables, gryffmdor¡¯s sword glass case gleaming moonlight, sorting hat shelf behind desk, fawkes¡¯s perch stood empty, still crying lament grounds 
new portrait joined ranks dead headmasters headmistresses hogwarts: dumbledore slumbering golden frame desk, half-moon spectacle perched upon crooked nose, looking peaceful untroubled 
glancing portrait, professor mcgonagall made odd movement though steeling herself, rounded the¡¯ desk look harry, face taut lined 
¡°harry,¡± said, ¡°i would like know professor dumbledore evening left school

¡°snape!¡± ejaculated slughorn, looked shaken, pale sweating 
¡°snape! taught him! thought knew him!¡± could respond this, sharp voice spoke high wall: sallow-faced wizard short black fringe walked back empty canvas 
¡°minerva, minister within seconds, disapparated ministry 
¡± ¡°thank you, everard,¡± said professor mcgonagall, turned quickly teachers 
¡°i want talk happens hogwarts gets here,¡± said quickly

¡°parents want keep children home can¡¯t say blame

¡°and case, true say dumbledore never envisaged situation hogwarts might close 
chamber secrets reopened considered closure school ¡ª must say professor dumbledore ¡¯s murder disturbing idea slytherin¡¯s monster living undetected bowels castle 


¡± ¡°we must consult governors,¡± said professor flitwick squeaky little voice; large bruise forehead seemed otherwise unscathed collapse snape¡¯s office 
¡°we must follow established procedures 
decision made hastily 
¡± ¡°hagrid, haven¡¯t said anything,¡± said professor mcgonagall 
¡°what views, ought hogwarts remain open?¡± hagrid, weeping silently large, spotted handkerchief throughout conversation, raised puffy red eyes croaked, ¡°i dunno, professor

¡°very well,¡± said professor mcgonagall, glancing window grounds, checking see whether minister yet approaching, ¡°then must agree filius right thing consult governors, make final decision 
¡°now, getting students home 


argument sooner rather later 
could arrange hogwarts express come tomorrow necessary ¡ª ¡± ¡°what dumbledore ¡¯s funeral?¡± said harry, speaking last

¡°if ministry thi nk appropriate,¡± said professor mcgonagall

¡°is true?¡± whispered fat lady approached 
¡°it really true? dumbledore ¡ª dead?¡± ¡°yes,¡± said harry 
let wail and, without waiting password, swung forward admit 
harry suspected would be, common room jam-packed 
room fell silent climbed portrait hole 
saw dean seamus sitting group nearby: meant dormitory must empty, nearly 
without speaking anybody, without making eye contact all, harry walked straight across room door boys¡¯ dormitories 
hoped, ron waiting him, still fully dressed, sitting bed 
harry sat four-poster moment, simply stared 
¡°they¡¯re talking closing school,¡± said harry 
¡°lupin said would,¡± said ron 
pause 
¡°so?¡± said ron low voice, though thought furniture might listening 
¡°did find one? get it? ¡ª horcrux?¡± harry shook head 
taken place around black lake seemed like old nightmare now; really happened, hours ago? ¡°you didn¡¯t get it?¡± said ron, looking crestfallen 
¡°it wasn¡¯t there?¡± ¡°no,¡± said harry 
¡°someone already taken left fake place 
¡± ¡°already taken ¡ª ?¡± wordlessly, harry pulled fake locket pocket, opened it, passed ron 
full story could wait

nothing mattered except end, end pointless adventure, end dumbledore¡¯s life

fawkes stopped singing 
knew, without knowing knew it, ilie phoenix gone, left hogwarts good, dumbledore left school, left world 


left harry 
chapter thirty white tomb lessons suspended, examinations postponed 
students hurried away hogwarts parents next couple days ¡ª patil twins gone breakfast morning following dumbledore¡¯s death zacharias smith escorted castle haughty-looking father 
seamus finnigan, hand, refused point- blank accompany mother home; shouting match entrance hall resolved agreed could remain behind funeral 
difficulty finding bed hogsmeade, seamus told harry ron, wizards witches pouring village, preparing pay last respects dumbledore 
excitement caused among younger students, never seen before, powder-blue carriage size house, pulled dozen giant winged palominos, came soaring sky late afternoon funeral landed edge forest 
harry watched window gigantic handsome olive-skinned, black-haired woman descended carriage steps threw waiting hagrid¡¯s arms 
meanwhile delegation ministry officials, including minister magic himself, accommodated within castle 
harry diligently avoiding contact them; sure that, sooner later, would asked account dumbledore¡¯s last excursion hogwarts 
harry, ron, hermione ginny spending time together 
beautiful weather seemed mock them; harry could imagine would dumbledore died, time together end year, ginny ¡¯s examinations finished, pressure homework lifted 


hour hour, put saying thing knew must say, knew right do, hard forgo best source comfort 
visited hospital wing twice day: neville discharged, bill remained madam pomfrey¡¯s care 
scars bad ever; truth, bore distinct resemblance mad-eye moody, though thankfully eyes legs, personality seemed ever

¡° 


eet ees lucky ¡®e marrying me,¡± said fleur happily, plumping bill¡¯s pillows, ¡°because ze british overcook meat, ¡®ave always said

¡®tjgly, though,¡± added hastily, ginny raised eyebrows, let reluctant giggle 
¡°well, suppose mum stand it,

hermione winced forced toughness voice 
¡°no,¡± said reprovingly, folding ihe newspaper 
¡°they¡¯re still looking snape, sign 


¡± ¡°of course isn¡¯t,¡± said harry, became angry every lime subject cropped 
¡°they won¡¯t find snape till find voldemort, seeing they¡¯ve never managed time 


¡± ¡°i¡¯m going go bed,¡± yawned ginny 
¡°i haven¡¯t sleeping well since 


well

¡± kissed harry (ron looked away pointedly), waved two departed girls¡¯ donnitories 
moment door closed behind her, hermione leaned forwards towards harry hennione-ish look face 
¡°harry, found something morning, library

¡°no,¡± said sadly, ¡°i¡¯ve trying, harry, haven¡¯t found anything

judging note, person stole horcrux knew voldemort, can¡¯t find shred evidence bungs axebanger ever anything 


no, actually, it¡¯s 


well, snape 
¡± looked nervous even saying name 
¡°what him?¡± asked harry heavily, slumping back chair 
¡°well, it¡¯s sort right half-blood prince business,¡± said tentatively 
¡°d¡¯you rub in, hermione? think feel now?¡± ¡°no ¡ª ¡ª harry, didn¡¯t mean that!¡± said hastily, looking around check overheard 
¡°it¡¯s right eileen prince owning book

hennione ignored 
¡°i going rest old prophets tiny announcement eileen prince marrying man called tobias snape, later announcement saying she¡¯d given birth ¡ª ¡± ¡° ¡ª murderer,¡± spat harry 
¡°well 


yes,¡± said hermione 
¡°so 


sort right 
snape must proud ¡®half prince¡¯, see? tobias snape muggle said prophet¡± ¡°yeah, fits,¡± said harry 
¡°he¡¯d play pure-blood side could get lucius malfoy rest 


he¡¯s like voldemort 
pure-blood mother, muggle father 


ashamed parentage, trying make feared using dark arts, gave impressive new name ¡ª lord voldemort ¡ª half-blood prince - could dumbledore missed ¡ª ?¡± broke off, looking window 
could stop dwelling upon dumbledore¡¯s inexcusable trust snape 


hermione inadvertently reminded him, he, harry, taken 


spite increasing nastiness scribbled spells, refused believe ill boy clever, helped much 


helped 



almost unendurable thought, 


¡°i still don¡¯t get didn¡¯t turn using book,¡± said ron 
¡°he must¡¯ve known getting

¡°he knew used sectumsempra

might even known then, slughom talking brilliant potions 


shouldn¡¯t left old book bottom cupboard, he?¡± ¡°but didn¡¯t turn in?¡± ¡°i don¡¯t ihink wanted associate book,¡± said hermione 
¡°i don¡¯t think dumbledore would liked much he¡¯d known 
even snape pretended hadn¡¯t his, slughom would recognised writing 
anyway, book left snape¡¯s old classroom, i¡¯ll bet dumbledore knew mother called ¡®prince¡¯ 
¡± ¡°i should¡¯ve shown book dumbledore,¡± said harry 
¡°all time showing voldemort evil even school, proof snape was, ¡ª ¡± ¡°¡®evil¡¯ strong word,¡± said hermione quietly 
¡°you one kept telling book dangerous!¡± ¡°i¡¯m trying say, harry, you¡¯re pulling much blame 
thought prince seemed nasty sense humour, would never guessed potential killer 


¡± ¡°none us could¡¯ve guessed snape would 


know,¡± said ron 
silence fell them, lost thoughts, harry sure they, like him, thinking following morning, dumbledore ¡¯s body would laid rest 
harry never attended funeral before; body bury sirius died 
know expect little worried might see, would feel 
wondered whether dumbledore¡¯s death would real funeral 
though moments horrible fact threatened overwhelm him, blank stretches numbness where, despite fact nobody talking anything else whole castle, still found difficult believe dumbledore really gone 
admittedly not, sirius, looked desperately kind loophole, way dumbledore would come back 


felt pocket cold chain fake horcrux, carried everywhere, talisman, reminder cost remained still 
harry rose early pack next day; hogwarts express would leaving hour funeral 
downstairs found mood great hall subdued 
everybody wearing dress robes one seemed hungry 
professor mcgonagall left thronelike chair middle staff table empty 
hagrid¡¯s chair deserted too: harry thought perhaps able face breakfast; snape¡¯s place unceremoniously filled rufus scrimgeour 
harry avoided yellowish eyes scanned hall; harry uncomfortable feeling scrimgeour looking 
among scrimgeour¡¯ entourage harry spotted red hair horn-rimmed glasses percy weasley 
ron gave sign aware percy, apart stabbing pieces kipper unwonted venom 
slytherin table crabbe goyle muttering together 
hulking boys though were, looked oddly lonely without tall, pale figure malfoy them, bossing around 
harry spared malfoy much thought 
animosity snape, forgotten fear malfoy¡¯s voice tower top, fact lowered wand death eaters arrived 
harry believe malfoy would killed dumbledore 
despised malfoy still infatuation dark arts, tiniest drop pity mingled dislike 
where, harry wondered, malfoy now, voldemort making threat killing parents? harry¡¯s thoughts interrupted nudge ribs ginny 
professor mcgonagall risen feet mournful hum hall died away 
¡°it nearly time,¡± said 
¡°please follow heads house grounds 
gryffindors, 
¡± filed behind benches near silence 
harry glimpsed slughorn head slytherin column, wearing magnificent long emerald-green robes embroidered silver 
never seen professor sprout, head hufflepuffs, looking clean; single patch hat, reached entrance hall, found madam pince standing beside filch, thick black veil fell knees, ancient black suit tie reek-ing mothbails 
heading, harry saw stepped stone steps front doors, towards lake 
warmth sun caressed face followed professor mcgonagall silence place hundreds chairs set rows 
aisle ran centre them: marble table standing front, chairs facing 
beautiful summer¡¯s day 
extraordinary assortment people already settled half chairs: shabby smart, old young 
harry recognise, did, including members order phoenix: kingsley shacklebolt, mad-eye moody, tonks, hair miraculously returned vividest pink, remus lupin, seemed holding hands, mr 
mrs 
weasley, bill supported fleur followed fred george, wearing jackets black dragonskin 
madame maxime, took two- and-a-half chairs own, tom, landlord leaky cauldron, arabella figg, harry¡¯s squib neighbour, hairy bass player wizarding group weird sisters, ernie prang, driver knight bus, madam malkin, robe shop diagon alley, people harry merely knew sight, barman hog¡¯s head witch pushed trolley hogwarts express 
castle ghosts too, barely visible bright sunlight, discernible moved, shimmering insubstantially gleaming air 
harry, ron, hermione ginny filed seats end row beside lake 
people whispering other; sounded like breeze grass, birdsong louder far 
crowd continued swell; great rush affection them, harry saw neville helped seat luna 
alone 

responded hermione¡¯s summons night dumbledore died, harry knew why: ones missed 




probably ones checked coins regularly hope would another meeting 
cornelius fudge walked past towards front rows, expression miserable, twirling green bowler hat usual; harry next recognised rita skeeter, who, infuriated see, notebook clutched red-taloned hand; then, worse jolt fury, dolores umbridge, unconvincing expression grief upon toadlike face, black velvet bow set atop iron-colored curls 
sight centaur firenze, standing like sentinel near water¡¯s edge, gave start scurried hastily seat good distance away 
staff seated last 
harry could see scrimgeour looking grave dignified front row professor mcgonagall 
wondered whether scrimgeour important people really sorry dumbledore dead 
heard music, strange, otherworldly music, forgot dislike ministry looking around source 
one: many heads turning, searching, little alarmed 
¡°in there,¡± whispered ginny harry¡¯s ear 
saw clear green sunlit water, inches surface, reminding horribly inferi; chorus merpeople singing strange language understand, pallid faces rippling, purplish hair flowing around 
music made hair harry¡¯s neck stand yet unpleasant 
spoke clearly loss despair 
looked wild faces singers feeling they, least, sorry dumbledore¡¯s passing 
ginny nudged looked round 
hagrid walking slowly aisle chairs 
crying quite silently, face gleaming tears, arms, wrapped purple velvet spangled golden stars, harry knew dumbledore¡¯s body 
sharp pain rose harry¡¯s throat sight: moment, strange music knowledge dumbledore¡¯s body close seemed take warmth day 
ron looked white shocked 
tears falling thick fast ginny hermione¡¯s laps 
could see clearly happening front 
hagrid seemed placed body carefully upon table 
retreated aisle, blowing nose loud trumpeting noises drew scandalised looks some, including, harry saw, dolores umbridge 


harry knew dumbledore would cared 
tried make friendly gesture hagrid passed, hagrid¡¯s eyes swollen wonder could see going 
harry glanced back row hagrid heading realized guiding him, there, dressed jacket trousers size small marquee, giant grawp, great ugly boulder-like head bowed, docile, almost human 
hagrid sat next half-brother grawp patted hagrid hard head, chair legs sank ground 
harry wonderful momentary urge laugh 
music stopped turned face front 
little tufty-haired man plain black robes got feet stood front dumbledore¡¯s body 
harry could hear saying 
odd words floated back hundreds beads 
¡°nobility spirit¡± 


¡°intellectual contribution¡± 


¡°greatness heart¡± 


mean much 
little dumbledore harry known 
suddenly remembered dumbledore¡¯s idea words: ¡°nitwit¡±, ¡°oddment¡±, ¡°blubber¡± ¡°tweak¡±, again, suppress grin 


matter him? soft splashing noise left saw merpeople broken surface listen, 
remembered dumbledore crouching water¡¯s edge two years ago, close harry sat, conversing mermish merchieftainess 
harry wondered dumbledore learned mermish 
much never asked him, much said 


then, without warning, swept him, dreadful truth, completely undeniably 
dumbledore dead, gone 


clutched cold locket hand tightly hurt, could prevent hot tears spilling eyes: looked away ginny others stared lake, towards forest, little man black droned 


movement among trees 
centaurs come pay respects, 
move open harry saw standing quite still, half- hidden shadow, watching wizards, bows hanging sides 
harry remembered first nightmarish trip forest, first time ever encountered thing voldemort, faced him, dumbledore discussed fighting losing battle long thereafter 
important, dumbledore said, fight, fight again, keep fighting, could evil kept bay, though never quite eradicated 


harry saw clearly sat hot sun people cared stood front one one, mother, father, godfather, finally dumbledore, determined protect him; 
could let anybody else stand voldemort; must abandon forever illusion ought lost age one: shelter parent¡¯s arms meant nothing could hurt 
waking nightmare, comforting whisper dark safe really, imagination; last greatest protectors died alone ever 
little man black stopped speaking last resumed seat 
harry waited somebody else get feet; expected speeches, probably minister, nobody moved 
several people screamed 
bright, white flames erupted around dumbledore¡¯s body table upon lay: higher higher rose, obscuring body 
white smoke spiralled air made strange shapes: harry thought, one heart-stopping moment, saw phoenix fly joyfully blue, next second fire vanished 
place white marble tomb, encasing dumbledore¡¯s body table rested 
cries shock shower arrows soared air, fell far short crowd 
was, harry knew, centaurs¡¯ tribute: saw turn tail disappear back cool trees 
likewise merpeople sank slowly back green water lost view 
harry looked ginny, ron hermione: ron¡¯s face screwed though sunlight blinding 
hennione¡¯s face glazed tears, ginny longer crying 
met harry¡¯s gaze hard, blazing look seen hugged winning quidditch cup absence, knew moment understood perfectly, told going now, would say ¡°be careful¡±, ¡°don¡¯t it¡±, accept decision, would expected anything less 
steeled say known must say ever since dumbledore died 
¡°ginny, listen 


¡± said quietly, buzz conversation grew louder around people began get feet 
¡°i can¡¯t involved anymore 
we¡¯ve got stop seeing 
can¡¯t together 
¡± said, oddly twisted smile, ¡°it¡¯s stupid, noble reason, isn¡¯t it?¡± ¡°it¡¯s like 


like something someone else¡¯s life, last weeks you,¡± said harry 
¡°but can¡¯t 


can¡¯t 


i¡¯ve got things alone 
¡± cry, simply looked him, ¡°voldemort uses people enemies close 
he¡¯s already used bait once, you¡¯re best friend¡¯s sister 
think much danger you¡¯ll keep 
he¡¯ll know, he¡¯ll find 
he¡¯ll try get 
¡± ¡°what don¡¯t care?¡± said ginny fiercely 
¡°i care,¡± said harry 
¡°how think i¡¯d feel funeral

¡± looked away him, lake 
¡°i never really gave you,¡± said 
¡°not really 
always hoped 


hermione told get life, maybe go people, relax bit around you, never used able talk room, remember? thought might take bit notice bit ¡ª 
¡± ¡°smart girl, hermione,¡± said harry, trying smile 
¡°i wish i¡¯d asked sooner 
could ¡®ve ages 


months 


years maybe 


¡± ¡°but you¡¯ve busy saving wizarding world,¡± said ginny, half-laughing 
¡°well 


can¡¯t say i¡¯m surprised 
knew would happen end 
knew wouldn¡¯t happy unless hunting voldemort 
maybe that¡¯s like much 
¡± harry could bear hear things, think resolution would hold remained sitting beside 
ron, saw, holding hermione stroking hair sobbed shoulder, tears dripping end long nose 
miserable gesture, harry got up, turned back ginny dumbledore¡¯s tomb walked away around lake 
moving felt much bearable sitting still: setting soon possible track horcruxes kill voldemort would feel better waiting 


¡°harry!¡± turned 
rufus scrimgeour limping rapidly towards around bank, leaning walking stick 
¡°i¡¯ve hoping word 


mind walk little way you?¡± ¡°no,¡± said harry indifferently, set 
¡°harry, dreadful tragedy,¡± said scrimgeour quietly, ¡°i cannot tell appalled hear
