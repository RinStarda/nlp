When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up on the dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was 
nothing about the cloudy sky outside to suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon 
be happening all over the country. Mr. Dursley hummed as he picked out his most boring tie for 
work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily as she wrestled a screaming Dudley into his high 
chair. 

None of them noticed a large, tawny owl flutter past the window. 

At half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley on the cheek, and 
tried to kiss Dudley good-bye but missed, because Dudley was now having a tantrum and 
throwing his cereal at the walls. 

¡°Little tyke,¡± chortled Mr. Dursley as he left the house. He got into his car and backed out of 
number four¡¯s drive.
